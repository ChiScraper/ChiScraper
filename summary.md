### Evidence for a shock-compressed magnetic field in the northwestern rim of Vela Jr. from X-ray polarimetry
**Dmitry A. Prokhorov,Yi-Jung Yang,Riccardo Ferrazzoli,Jacco Vink,Patrick Slane,Enrico Costa,...**


#plasma
### Abstract:
Synchrotron X-ray emission has been detected from nearly a dozen young supernova remnants (SNRs). X-rays of synchrotron origin exhibit linear polarization in a regular, non-randomly oriented magnetic field. The significant polarized X-ray emission from four such SNRs has already been reported on the basis of observations with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). The magnetic-field structure as derived from IXPE observations is radial for Cassiopeia A, Tychos SNR, and SN 1006, and tangential for RX J1713.7-3946. The latter together with the recent detection of a tangential magnetic field in SNR 1E 0102.2-7219 by the Australia Telescope Compact Array in the radio band shows that tangential magnetic fields can also be present in young SNRs. Thus, the dichotomy in polarization between young and middle-aged SNRs (radial magnetic fields in young SNRs, but tangential magnetic fields in middle-aged SNRs), previously noticed in the radio band, deserves additional attention. The present analysis of IXPE observations determines, for the first time, a magnetic-field structure in the northwestern rim of Vela Jr, also known as RX J0852.0-4622, and provides a new example of a young SNR with a tangential magnetic field.

### Generative Simulations of The Solar Corona Evolution With Denoising Diffusion ... Proof of Concept
**Gregoire Francisco,Francesco Pio Ramunno,Manolis K. Georgoulis,Joao Fernandes,Teresa Barata,Dario Del Moro**


#plasma
### Abstract:
The solar magnetized corona is responsible for various manifestations with a space weather impact, such as flares, coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and, naturally, the solar wind. Modeling the coronas dynamics and evolution is therefore critical for improving our ability to predict space weather In this work, we demonstrate that generative deep learning methods, such as Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM), can be successfully applied to simulate future evolutions of the corona as observed in Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) wavelengths. Our model takes a 12-hour video of an Active Region (AR) as input and simulate the potential evolution of the AR over the subsequent 12 hours, with a time-resolution of two hours. We propose a light UNet backbone architecture adapted to our problem by adding 1D temporal convolutions after each classical 2D spatial ones, and spatio-temporal attention in the bottleneck part. The model not only produce visually realistic outputs but also captures the inherent stochasticity of the systems evolution. Notably, the simulations enable the generation of reliable confidence intervals for key predictive metrics such as the EUV peak flux and fluence of the ARs, paving the way for probabilistic and interpretable space weather forecasting. Future studies will focus on shorter forecasting horizons with increased spatial and temporal resolution, aiming at reducing the uncertainty of the simulations and providing practical applications for space weather forecasting.

### AI Justification:
This paper offers insights into the evolution of magnetic fields in the solar corona, which is relevant to my interest in "magnetic dynamics of plasmas" as it explores how the corona's dynamics—affected by magnetic forces—relate to space weather phenomena such as flares and CMEs. The application of generative deep learning methods can provide a novel approach to understanding "scale-dependent magnetic structuring" in an astrophysical plasma environment, specifically regarding the amplification and interaction of magnetic fields over time.

### Supersensitive seismic magnetometry on white dwarfs
**Nicholas Z. Rui,Jim Fuller,J. J. Hermes**


#plasma
### Abstract:
The origin of magnetic fields in white dwarfs (WDs) remains mysterious. Magnetic WDs are traditionally associated with field strengths $\gtrsim1\,\mathrm{MG}$ , set by the sensitivity of typical spectroscopic magnetic field measurements. Informed by recent developments in red giant magnetoasteroseismology, we revisit the use of WD pulsations as a seismic magnetometer. WD pulsations primarily probe near-surface magnetic fields, whose effect on oscillation mode frequencies is to asymmetrize rotational multiplets and, if strong enough, suppress gravity-mode propagation altogether. The sensitivity of seismology to magnetic fields increases strongly with mode period and decreases quickly with the depth of the partial ionization-driven surface convective zone. We place upper limits for magnetic fields in $24$ pulsating WDs... $20$ hydrogen-atmosphere (DAV) and three helium-atmosphere (DBV) carbon-oxygen WDs, and one extremely low-mass (helium-core) pulsator. These bounds are typically $\sim1$ - $10\,\mathrm{kG}$ , although they can reach down to $\sim10$ - $100\,\mathrm{G}$ for DAVs and helium-core WDs in which lower-frequency modes are excited. Seismic magnetometry may enable new insights into the formation and evolution of WD magnetism.

### AI Justification:
This paper is somewhat relevant to your research interests because it addresses the "origin of magnetic fields in white dwarfs," which ties into your focus on "magnetic field amplification" and the mechanisms driving the evolution of magnetic fields in astrophysical contexts. Although it specifically examines white dwarfs rather than the interstellar medium, the methods of seismic magnetometry and the implications for understanding "the formation and evolution of WD magnetism" may provide valuable insights into magnetic dynamics that could be applicable across various scales in interstellar environments.

### Interplanetary Rotation of 2021 December 4 CME
**Mengxuan Ma,Liping Yang,Fang Shen,Chenglong Shen,Yutian Chi,Yuming Wang,...**


#plasma
### Abstract:
The magnetic orientation of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) is of great importance to understand their space weather effects. Although many evidences suggest that CMEs can undergo significant rotation during the early phases of evolution in the solar corona, there are few reports that CMEs rotate in the interplanetary space. In this work, we use multi-spacecraft observations and a numerical simulation starting from the lower corona close to the solar surface to understand the CME event on 2021 December 4, with an emphatic investigation of its rotation. This event is observed as a partial halo CME from the back side of the Sun by coronagraphs, and reaches the BepiColombo spacecraft and the MAVEN/Tianwen-1 as a magnetic flux rope-like structure. The simulation discloses that in the solar corona the CME is approximately a translational motion, while the interplanetary propagation process evidences a gradual change of axis orientation of the CMEs flux rope-like structure. It is also found that the downside and the right flank of the CME moves with the fast solar wind, and the upside does in the slow-speed stream. The different parts of the CME with different speeds generate the nonidentical displacements of its magnetic structure, resulting in the rotation of the CME in the interplanetary space. Furthermore, at the right flank of the CME exists a corotating interaction region (CIR), which makes the orientation of the CME alter, and also deviates from its route due to the CME. These results provide new insight on interpreting CMEs dynamics and structures during their travelling through the heliosphere.


![[mdfiles/2410.20803.md|2410.20803]]
### AI Justification:
The paper contributes relevant insights into the dynamics of magnetic fields, as it explores the rotation of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and their magnetic structures during propagation through interplanetary space. While the specific focus on CMEs does not directly align with my primary interests in the interstellar medium, the paper's examination of "different parts of the CME" and their "nonidentical displacements of its magnetic structure" touches on the complexity of magnetic dynamics which parallels my interest in "magnetic field amplification" and "force interactions shaping magnetic dynamics."

### Magnetic activity in close binary systems
**Zs. Kovari**


#plasma
### Abstract:
Tidal forces in close binary systems have diverse impacts on magnetic activity. The synchronicity characteristic of close systems counteracts magnetic braking, thereby sustaining rapid rotation-a key factor in increased levels of magnetic activity. Tidal effects can also work against the slowing down of rotation during stellar evolution, when the star inflates into a red giant. A notable manifestation of the effect of binarity on activity in such systems is the appearance of active longitudes, which are thought to arise from the excitation of non-axisymmetric dynamo modes. Through some recent examples, the dynamo operation in RS CVn and BY Dra type systems is briefly reviewed in terms of spot cycles, active longitudes, flare activity, and differential rotation.


![[mdfiles/2410.20961.md|2410.20961]]
### AI Justification:
This paper touches on the concept of magnetic activity within the context of close binary systems, particularly focusing on dynamo mechanisms and the impact of tidal forces on magnetic behavior, aligning somewhat with my interest in "Magnetic Field Amplification" and "Emergent Magnetic Dynamics in Turbulent Plasmas." However, its primary focus seems to be on stellar activity related to binarity rather than the broader interstellar medium context or the scale-dependent dynamics that I am studying.

### Hollow Beam Optical Ponderomotive Trap for Ultracold Neutral Plasma
**S. A. Saakyan**


#plasma
### Abstract:
Rapidly oscillating, inhomogeneous electromagnetic field from laser exert a force that repels charged particles from regions of high light intensity. This work examines the potential of ponderomotive optical confinement for ultracold neutral plasma (UNP) using a high-power cw CO $_2$ laser. We identify optimal conditions for experimental realization and investigate transient processes during UNP expansion in the ponderomotive potential. A hollow laser beam simultaneously traps charged particles and Rydberg atoms formed via three-body recombination in UNP in the dark region, alongside neutral atoms in intensity maxima. This dual trapping capability has the potential to be applied in the trapping of antiproton-positron plasma, which could enhance antimatter production.


![[mdfiles/2410.21065.md|2410.21065]]
### AI Justification:
The paper presents a novel approach to plasma dynamics using "ponderomotive optical confinement," which may not directly align with my focus on the "magnetic dynamics of plasmas" but touches upon relevant experimental techniques that could advance understanding of plasma behavior. However, the emphasis on "trapping charged particles" and "neutral atoms" does not specifically address the amplification and interaction of magnetic fields across the scales of interest in my research.

### Detecting and sizing the Earth with PLATO... A feasibility study based on solar data
**A. F. Krenn,M. Lendl,S. Sulis,M. Deleuil,S. J. Hofmeister,N. Jannsen,...**


#plasma
### Abstract:
Context. The PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations of stars (PLATO) mission will observe the same area of the sky continuously for at least two years in an effort to detect transit signals of an Earth-like planet orbiting a solar-like star. Aims. We aim to study how short-term solar-like variability caused by oscillations and granulation would affect PLATOs ability to detect and size Earth if PLATO were to observe the Solar System itself. Methods. We injected Earth-like transit signals onto real solar data taken by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) instrument. We isolated short-term stellar variability by removing any variability with characteristic timescales longer than five hours. We then added a noise model for a variety of different stellar magnitudes computed by PlatoSim assuming an observation by all 24 normal cameras. We first compared four different commonly used treatments of correlated noise in the time domain. We then tried to recover pairs of transit signals. Finally, we performed transit fits using realistic priors on planetary and stellar parameters. Results. We find that short-term solar-like variability affects the correct retrieval of Earth-like transit signals in PLATO data. Variability models accounting for variations with typical timescales at the order of one hour are sufficient to mitigate these effects. For bright targets (8.5 - 10.5 mag), the transit signal of an Earth analogue can reliably be detected in PLATO data. For faint targets the results of transit search algorithms have to be verified by transit-fitting algorithms to avoid false positive detections being flagged. For bright targets (V-mag $\leq$ 9.5), the radius of an Earth-like planet orbiting a solar-like star can be correctly determined at a precision of 3% or less, assuming that at least two transit events are observed and the characteristics of the host star are well understood.


![[mdfiles/2410.20077.md|2410.20077]]
### AI Justification:
The paper focuses primarily on the detection of Earth-like planets through the analysis of solar data, which does not align well with my interest in the "magnetic dynamics of plasmas in the interstellar medium." While there are elements of variability in solar data mentioned in the methods, the study lacks an exploration of "magnetic field amplification" or the "complex, multi-scale dynamics of magnetic fields in plasma environments" that are central to my research focus.

### Exact theory of edge diffraction and launching of transverse electric plasmons at two-dimensional junctions
**Dmitry Svintsov**


#plasma
### Abstract:
An exact solution for electromagnetic wave diffraction at the junction of two-dimensional electron systems (2DES) is obtained and analyzed for electric field polarized along the edge. A special emphasis is paid to the metal-contacted and terminated edges. In the former case, electric field at the edge tends to zero; in the latter case, it tends to a finite value which is screened by 2d system in an anomalous fashion. For both types of edge and capacitive type of 2d conductivity, an incident wave excites transverse electric 2d plasmons. The amplitude of excited TE plasmons is maximized and becomes order of incident wave amplitude for capacitive impedance of 2DES order of free space impedance. For both large and small 2DES impedance, the amplitude of TE plasmons tends to zero according to the power laws which are explicitly derived.
