### Magnetic Fields Under Feedback... A Case Study of the Massive Star-Forming Hub G34.26+0.15
**Zacariyya A. Khan,Kate Pattle,Sarah F. Graves**


#plasma
### Abstract:
We present 850 $\mu$ m polarized observations of the molecular cloud G34.26+0.15 taken using the POL-2 polarimeter mounted on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT). G34.26+0.15 is a hub-filament system with ongoing high-mass star-formation, containing multiple HII regions. We extend the Histogram of Relative Orientations technique with an alternative application that considers the alignment of the magnetic field to the filaments and a HII region boundary, denoted as the filament alignment factor ( $\xi_{F}$ ) and the ellipse alignment factor ( $\xi_{E}$ ) respectively. Using these metrics, we find that, although in general the magnetic field aligns parallel to the filamentary structure within the system in the north-west, the magnetic field structure of G34.26+0.15 has been radically reshaped by the expansion of an evolved HII region in the south-east, which itself may have triggered further high-mass star formation in the cloud. Thus, we suggest high-mass star formation is both occurring through mass accretion as per the hub-filament model from one side, and through compression of gas under stellar feedback from the other. We also use HARP observations of C $^{18}$ O from the CHIMPS survey to estimate the magnetic field strength across the cloud, finding strengths of $\sim$ 0.5-1.4 mG.

### Magnetic Field Amplification during Stellar Collisions between Low-Mass Stars
**Taeho Ryu,Alison Sills,Ruediger Pakmor,Selma de Mink,Robert Mathieu**


#plasma
### Abstract:
Blue straggler stars in stellar clusters are a subset of stars that are bluer and appear younger than other cluster members, seemingly straggling behind in their evolution. They offer a unique opportunity to understand the stellar dynamics and populations within their hosts. In the collisional formation scenario, a persistent challenge is the excessive angular momentum in the collision product. The consequent significant mass loss during transition to a stable state leads to a star with too low a mass to be a blue straggler, unless it spins down efficiently. While many proposed spin-down mechanisms involve boosted angular momentum loss via magnetic braking within the collision product, the existence or strength of these magnetic fields has not been confirmed. Here, we report three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical simulations of collisions between two low-mass main-sequence stars and investigate magnetic field amplification. Magnetic field energy is amplified by a factor of $10^{8}-10^{10}$ , resulting in the magnetic field strength of $10^{7}-10^{8}$ G at the core of the collision product, independent of collision parameters. The surface magnetic field strengths have increased up to $10-10^{4}$ G. In addition, a distinctly flattened, rotating gas structure appears around the collision products in off-axis collisions, which may be a hint of possible disk formation. Such significant magnetic amplification and potential disk formation suggest the possibility of efficient spin-down of collision products via magnetic braking and magnetic disk locking, which can result in their appearance as blue stragglers.

### Residual Energy and Broken Symmetry in Reduced Magnetohydrodynamics
**S. Dorfman,M. Abler,S. Boldyrev,C. H. K. Chen,S. Greess**


#plasma
### Abstract:
Alfv\enic interactions which transfer energy from large to small spatial scales lie at the heart of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. An important feature of the turbulence is the generation of negative residual energy -- excess energy in magnetic fluctuations compared to velocity fluctuations. By contrast, an MHD Alfv\en wave has equal amounts of energy in fluctuations of each type. Alfv\enic quasimodes that do not satisfy the Alfv\en wave dispersion relation and exist only in the presence of a nonlinear term can contain either positive or negative residual energy, but until now an intuitive physical explanation for why negative residual energy is preferred has remained elusive. This paper shows that the equations of reduced MHD are symmetric in that they have no intrinsic preference for one sign of the residual energy over the other. An initial state that is not an exact solution to the equations can break this symmetry in a way that leads to net-negative residual energy generation. Such a state leads to a solution with three distinct parts... nonresonant Alfv\enic quasimodes, normal modes produced to satisfy initial conditions, and resonant normal modes that grow in time. The latter two parts strongly depend on initial conditions; the resulting symmetry breaking leads to net-negative residual energy both in Alfv\enic quasimodes and $\omega=k_\parallel{V_A}=0$ modes. These modes have net-positive residual energy in the equivalent boundary value problem, suggesting that the initial value setup is a better match for solar wind turbulence.

### Growth of Massive Molecular Cloud Filament by Accretion Flows. II. New Mechanism to Support a Supercritical Filament against Radial Collapse
**Daisei Abe,Tsuyoshi Inoue,Shu-ichiro Inutsuka,Doris Arzoumanian**


#plasma
### Abstract:
Observations indicate that dense molecular filamentary clouds are sites of star formation. The filament width determines the fragmentation scale and influences the stellar mass. Therefore, understanding the evolution of filaments and the origin of their properties is important for understanding star formation. Although observations show a universal width of 0.1 pc, theoretical studies predict the contraction of thermally supercritical filaments (> 17 Msun pc-1) due to radial collapse. Through non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics simulations with ambipolar diffusion, we explore the formation and evolution of filaments via slow-shock instability at the front of accretion flows. We reveal that ambipolar diffusion allows the gas in the filament to flow across the magnetic fields around the shock, forming dense blobs behind the concave points of the shock. The blobs transfer momentum that drives internal turbulence. We name this mechanism the `STORM` (Slow-shock-mediated Turbulent flOw Reinforced by Magnetic diffusion). The persistence and efficiency of the turbulence inside the filament are driven by the magnetic field and the ambipolar diffusion effect, respectively. The STORM sustains the width even when the filament reaches very large line masses (~ 100 Msun pc-1).

### Turbulent Dynamo and Magnetic Fields in the Multiphase Interstellar Medium
**Amit Seta**


#plasma
### Abstract:
Even though the interstellar medium (ISM) of star-forming galaxies has been known to have a multiphase structure (broadly hot, warm, and cold phases) since the 1970s, how magnetic fields differ between the ISM phases is still unknown. Using results from numerical simulations, this work explores how the multiphase nature of the ISM shapes magnetic fields and then discusses possible implications of those results for polarisation observations of the Milky Way and high-redshift galaxies. These findings will enhance our understanding of the role of magnetic fields in galaxy evolution and prepare us to harness the upcoming wealth of radio polarisation data from the Square Kilometre Array and its pathfinders.

### Self-similarity and growth of non-linear magnetic Rayleigh-Taylor instability -- Role of the magnetic field strength
**Manohar Teja Kalluri,Andrew Hillier**


#plasma
### Abstract:
The non-linear regime of the magnetic Rayleigh-Taylor instability (MRTI) plays a crucial role in the transportation and mixing of material in a wide range of laboratory to astrophysical systems. But several fundamental aspects of this regime remain poorly understood. Previous MRTI studies assumed MRTI to have a self-similar, quadratic growth in the non-linear regime, similar to the hydrodynamic (HD) RTI. However, neither the self-similarity nor the relevance of the HD scaling for the MRTI has been proved analytically. Further, the role of magnetic field on the evolution of the instability remain unexplored. Towards this, we perform analytical and numerical study of the MRTI with uniform magnetic field. Our study reveals that the imposed magnetic field deviates the MRTI evolution from self-similarity. However, the HD RTI scaling becomes relevant to the MRTI evolution when the non-linear dynamics dominate the imposed magnetic field. A formula for the $\alpha_{mhd}$ , a quantity which represents the non-linear growth of instability in the self-similar regime, was obtained. The formula of $\alpha_{mhd}$ highlight the physical processes that could dictate the growth of instability. Numerical simulations of the MRTI showed the quantitative variation of these physical processes and $\alpha_{mhd}$ across a wide range of magnetic field strengths. Thus, the current study proves, analytically and numerically, the role of magnetic fields on the evolution of MRTI and the factors that influence of non-linear growth constant of the instability.

### Cosmic Ray-Driven Galactic Winds with Resolved ISM and Ion-Neutral Damping
**Brandon Sike,Timon Thomas,Mateusz Ruszkowski,Christoph Pfrommer,Matthias Weber**


#plasma
### Abstract:
Feedback processes in galaxies dictate their structure and evolution. Baryons can be cycled through stars, which inject energy into the interstellar medium (ISM) in supernova explosions, fueling multiphase galactic winds. Cosmic rays (CRs) accelerated at supernova remnants are an important component of feedback. CRs can effectively contribute to wind driving; however, their impact heavily depends on the assumed CR transport model. We run high-resolution `tallbox` simulations of a patch of a galactic disk using the moving mesh magnetohydrodynamics code AREPO, including varied CR implementations and the CRISP non-equilibrium thermochemistry model. We characterize the impact of CR feedback on star formation and multiphase outflows. While CR-driven winds are able to supply energy to a global-scale wind, a purely thermal wind loses most of its energy by the time it reaches 3 kpc above the disk midplane. We further find that the adopted CR transport model significantly affects the steady-state of the wind. In the model with CR advection, streaming, diffusion, and nonlinear Landau damping, CRs provide very strong feedback. Additionally accounting for ion-neutral damping (IND) decouples CRs from the cold ISM, which reduces the impact of CRs on the star formation rate. Nevertheless, CRs in this most realistic model are able to accelerate warm gas and levitate cool gas in the wind but have little effect on cold gas and hot gas. This model displays moderate mass loading and significant CR energy loading, demonstrating that IND does not prevent CRs from providing effective feedback.

### Moving-mesh non-ideal magnetohydrodynamical simulations of the collapse of cloud cores to protostars
**Alexander C. Mayer,Oliver Zier,Thorsten Naab,Rudiger Pakmor,Paola Caselli,Alexei V. Ivlev,...**


#plasma
### Abstract:
Magnetic fields have been shown both observationally and through theoretical work to be an important factor in the formation of protostars and their accretion disks. Accurate modelling of the evolution of the magnetic field in low-ionization molecular cloud cores requires the inclusion of non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) processes, specifically Ohmic and ambipolar diffusion and the Hall effect. These have a profound influence on the efficiency of magnetic removal of angular momentum from protostellar disks and simulations that include them can avoid the `magnetic-braking catastrophe in which disks are not able to form. However, the impact of the Hall effect, in particular, is complex and remains poorly studied. In this work, we perform a large suite of simulations of the collapse of cloud cores to protostars with several non-ideal MHD chemistry models and initial core geometries using the moving-mesh code {\small AREPO}. We find that the efficiency of angular momentum removal is significantly reduced with respect to ideal MHD, in line with previous results. The Hall effect has a varied influence on the evolution of the disk which depends on the initial orientation of the magnetic field. This extends to the outflows seen in a subset of the models, where this effect can act to enhance or suppress them and open up new outflow channels. We conclude, in agreement with a subset of the previous literature, that the Hall effect is the dominant non-ideal MHD process in some collapse scenarios and thus should be included in simulations of protostellar disk formation.

### Anisotropic Velocity Fluctuations in Galaxy Mergers... A Probe of the Magnetic Field
**Yue Hu,Joseph Whittingham,A. Lazarian,Christoph Pfrommer,Siyao Xu,Thomas Berlok**


#plasma
### Abstract:
Magnetic fields and turbulence are fundamental to the evolution of galaxies, yet their precise measurement and analysis present significant challenges. The recently developed Velocity Gradient Technique (VGT), which capitalizes on the anisotropy inherent in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, represents a new method for mapping magnetic fields in galaxies using spectroscopic observations. Most validations of VGT thus far, however, have relied upon idealized MHD turbulence simulations, which lack the more complex dynamics found in galaxies and galaxy mergers. In this study, we scrutinize VGT using an AREPO-based cosmological galaxy merger simulation, testing its effectiveness across pre-merger, merging, and post-merger stages. We examine the underlying assumptions of VGT and probe the statistics of gas density, velocity, and magnetic fields over time. We find that velocity fluctuations are indeed anisotropic at each stage, being larger in the direction perpendicular to the local magnetic field, as required by VGT. We find, additionally, that galaxy mergers substantially intensify velocity and density fluctuations and amplify magnetic fields at all scales. The observed scaling behavior of the velocity fluctuations corresponds to $r^{1/2}$ up to 0.4~kpc, shifting to a steeper trend between 0.6 and 3~kpc, and to a shallower trend thereafter. The scaling of the magnetic field and density fluctuations at scales $\lesssim$ 1.0 kpc also predominantly aligns with $r^{1/2}$ . Finally, we compare results from VGT to those derived from polarization-based magnetic field measurements, finding consistent and statistically significant global agreement in all cases. This opens the way to applying VGT to external galaxies.

### Magnetic diffusion in Solar atmosphere produces measurable electric fields
**Tetsu Anan,Roberto Casini,Han Uitenbroek,Thomas A. Schad,Hector Socas-Navarro,Kiyoshi Ichimoto,...**


#plasma
### Abstract:
The efficient release of magnetic energy in astrophysical plasmas, such as during solar flares, can in principle be achieved through magnetic diffusion, at a rate determined by the associated electric field. However, attempts at measuring electric fields in the solar atmosphere are scarce, and none exist for sites where the magnetic energy is presumably released. Here, we present observations of an energetic event using the National Science Foundations Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope, where we detect the polarization signature of electric fields associated with magnetic diffusion. We measure the linear and circular polarization across the hydrogen H-epsilon Balmer line at 397 nm at the site of a brightening event in the solar chromosphere. Our spectro-polarimetric modeling demonstrates that the observed polarization signals can only be explained by the presence of electric fields, providing conclusive evidence of magnetic diffusion, and opening a new window for the quantitative study of this mechanism in space plasmas.

### SOFIA/HAWC+ Far-Infrared Polarimetric Large-Area CMZ Exploration Survey. IV. Relative Magnetic Field Orientation Throughout the CMZ
**Dylan M. Pare,David T. Chuss,Kaitlyn Karpovich,Natalie O. Butterfield,Jeffrey Inara Iulliano,Xing Pan,...**


#plasma
### Abstract:
The nature of the magnetic field structure throughout the Galactic Center (GC) has long been of interest. The recent Far-InfraREd Polarimetric Large-Area CMZ Exploration (FIREPLACE) Survey reveals preliminary connections between the seemingly distinct vertical and horizontal magnetic field distributions previously observed in the GC. We use the statistical techniques of the Histogram of Relative Orientation (HRO) and the Projected Rayleigh Statistic (PRS) to assess whether the CMZ magnetic field preferentially aligns with the column density gradient derived from CMZ molecular clouds or the morphology of the non-thermal emission of the GC NTF population. We find that there is a range of magnetic field orientations throughout the population of CMZ molecular clouds, ranging from parallel to perpendicular orientation. This range of orientations contrasts with what is observed in Galactic Disk star-forming regions. We also compare the magnetic field orientation from dust polarimetry with individual prominent NTFs, finding a preferred perpendicular relative orientation. This perpendicular orientation indicates that the vertical field component found in the FIREPLACE observations is not spatially confined to the NTFs, providing evidence for a more pervasive vertical field in the GC. We estimate an upper limit on the magnetic field strength for this vertical field of 4 mG. A field close to this upper limit would indicate that the NTFs are likely not local enhancements of a weaker background field and that the locations of the NTFs depend on proximity to sites of cosmic ray production.

### Applying the Velocity Gradient Technique in NGC 1333... Comparison with Dust Polarization Observations
**Archana Soam,Ka Ho Yuen,Ian Stephens,Chi Yan Law,Ka Wai Ho,Simon Coude**


#plasma
### Abstract:
Magnetic fields (B-fields) are ubiquitous in the interstellar medium (ISM), and they play an essential role in the formation of molecular clouds and subsequent star formation. However, B-fields in interstellar environments remain challenging to measure, and their properties typically need to be inferred from dust polarization observations over multiple physical scales. In this work, we seek to use a recently proposed approach called the Velocity Gradient Technique (VGT) to study B-fields in star-forming regions and compare the results with dust polarization observations in different wavelengths. The VGT is based on the anisotropic properties of eddies in magnetized turbulence to derive B-field properties in the ISM. We investigate that this technique is synergistic with dust polarimetry when applied to a turbulent diffused medium for the purpose of measuring its magnetization. Specifically, we use the VGT on molecular line data toward the NGC~1333 star-forming region ( $\rm ^{12}CO$ , $\rm ^{13}CO$ , $\rm C^{18}O$ , and $\rm N_{2}H^{+}$ ), and we compare the derived B-field properties with those inferred from 214 and 850~ $\mu$ m dust polarization observations of the region using SOFIA/HAWC+ and JCMT/POL-2, respectively. We estimate both the inclination angle and the 3D Alfv\enic Mach Number $M_A$ from the molecular line gradients. Crucially, testing this technique on gravitationally bound, dynamic, and turbulent regions, and comparing the results with those obtained from polarization observations at different wavelength, such as the plane-of-the-sky field orientation, is an important test on the applicability of the VGT in various density regimes of the ISM.

### The High-resolution Accretion Disks of Embedded protoStars (HADES) simulations. I. Impact of Protostellar Magnetic Fields on the Accretion Modes
**Brandt A. L. Gaches,Jonathan C. Tan,Anna L. Rosen,Rolf Kuiper**


#plasma
### Abstract:
How embedded, actively accreting low-mass protostars accrete their mass is still greatly debated. Observations are now piecing together the puzzle of embedded protostellar accretion, in particular with new facilities in the near-infrared. However, high-resolution theoretical models are still lacking, with a stark paucity of detailed simulations of these early phases. Here we present high-resolution non-ideal magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of a Solar mass protostar accreting at rates exceeding 10 $^{-6} M_{\odot}$ yr $^{-1}$ . We show the results of the accretion flow for four different protostellar magnetic fields, 10 G, 500 G, 1 kG, and 2 kG, combined with a disk magnetic field. For weaker (10 G and 500 G) protostar magnetic fields, accretion occurs via a turbulent boundary layer mode, with disk material impacting across the protostellar surface. In the 500 G model, the presence of a magnetically dominated outflow focuses the accretion towards the equator, slightly enhancing and ordering the accretion. For kG magnetic fields, the disk becomes truncated due to the protostellar dipole and exhibits magnetospheric accretion, with the 2 kG model having accretion bursts induced by the interchange instability. We present bolometric light curves for the models and find that they reproduce observations of Class I protostars from YSOVAR, with high bursts followed by an exponential decay possibly being a signature of instability-driven accretion. Finally, we present the filling fractions of accretion and find that 90\% of the mass is accreted in a surface area fraction of 10-20\%. These simulations will be extended in future work for a broader parameter space, with their high resolution and high temporal spacing able to explore a wide range of interesting protostellar physics.

### On the conservation of helicity by weak solutions of the 3D Euler and inviscid MHD equations
**Daniel W. Boutros,Edriss S. Titi**


#plasma
### Abstract:
Classical solutions of the three-dimensional Euler equations of an ideal incompressible fluid conserve the helicity. We introduce a new weak formulation of the vorticity formulation of the Euler equations in which (by implementing the Bony paradifferential calculus) the advection terms are interpreted as paraproducts for weak solutions with low regularity. Using this approach we establish an equation of local helicity balance, which gives a rigorous foundation to the concept of local helicity density and flux at low regularity. We provide a sufficient criterion for helicity conservation which is weaker than many of the existing sufficient criteria for helicity conservation in the literature. Subsequently, we prove a sufficient condition for the helicity to be conserved in the zero viscosity limit of the Navier-Stokes equations. Moreover, under additional assumptions we establish a relation between the defect measure (which is part of the local helicity balance) and a third-order structure function for solutions of the Euler equations. As a byproduct of the approach introduced in this paper, we also obtain a new sufficient condition for the conservation of magnetic helicity in the inviscid MHD equations, as well as for the kinematic dynamo model. Finally, it is known that classical solutions of the ideal (inviscid) MHD equations which have divergence-free initial data will remain divergence-free, but this need not hold for weak solutions. We show that weak solutions of the ideal MHD equations arising as weak- $*$ limits of Leray-Hopf weak solutions of the viscous and resistive MHD equations remain divergence-free in time.

### The role of magnetic boundaries in kinematic and self-consistent magnetohydrodynamic simulations of precession-driven dynamo action in a closed cylinder
**Andre Giesecke,Mike Wilbert,Jan Simkanin,Rainer Grauer,Frank Stefani**


#plasma
### Abstract:
We numerically examine dynamo action generated by a flow of an electrically conducting fluid in a precessing cylindrical cavity. We compare a simplified kinematic approach based on the solution of the magnetic induction equation with a prescribed velocity field with the results from a self-consistent three-dimensional simulation of the complete set of magnetohydrodynamic equations. The different kinematic models show a strong influence of the electromagnetic properties of outer layers, which manifests itself in the existence of two different branches with dynamo action. In all cases, we observe a minimum for the onset of dynamo action in a transitional regime, within which the hydrodynamic flow undergoes a change from a large-scale to a more small-scale, turbulent behaviour. However, significant differences in the absolute values for the critical magnetic Reynolds number occur, and they can be explained by the low rotation rate in the MHD simulations achievable for technical reasons. In these models the character of the dynamo solution is small-scale and the magnetic energy remains significantly smaller than the kinetic energy of the flow. In irregular intervals, we observe dynamo bursts with a local concentration of the magnetic field, resulting in a global increase of the magnetic energy by a factor of 3 to 5. However, diffusion of the local patches caused by strong local shear is too rapid, causing these features to exist for only a short period (i.e., shorter than a rotation period) so that their dynamical impact on the dynamo remains small. As the magnetic field is small-scale and weak, the nonlinear feedback on the flow through the Lorentz force remains small and arises essentially in terms of a slight damping of the fast timescales, whereas there is no noticeable change in flow amplitude compared to the hydrodynamic case.

### Effect of Turbulent Kinetic Helicity on Diffusive \b{eta} effect for Large Scale Dynamo
**Kiwan Park**


#plasma
### Abstract:
We investigated a plasma system with kinematic viscosity \(\nu = 0.006\) and magnetic diffusivity \(\eta = 0.006\), driven by helical kinetic energy, to study the dynamics of energy and helicity in magnetic diffusion. Using the numerical data obtained, we explored methods to determine the \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) coefficients that linearize the nonlinear electromotive force (EMF) and the dynamo process. Initially, we applied conventional statistical approaches such as mean-field theory (MFT), direct interaction approximation (DIA), and eddy-damped quasinormal Markovian (EDQNM) closure. We then proposed a simpler alternative method using large-scale magnetic data and turbulent kinetic data to calculate \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\). Our findings show that while \(\alpha\) qualitatively aligns with theoretical predictions, \(\beta\) remains negative, indicating an inverse cascade of energy through magnetic diffusion. This deviated from conventional models and was further analyzed using a recursive method in the second moment identity, revealing that small-scale kinetic helicity couples with large-scale current density to transport energy inversely. We validated our method by reproducing the numerically calculated data. The consistency between our method and direct numerical simulations (DNS) suggests that the negative diffusion process in plasma has a physical basis.

### The Discovery of Polarized Water Vapor Megamaser Emission in a Molecular Accretion Disk
**Jack F. Gallimore,C. M. Violette Impellizzeri,Samaneh Aghelpasand,Feng Gao,Virginia Hostetter,Boy Lankhaar**


#plasma
### Abstract:
For the first time in an extragalactic source, we detect linearly polarized water maser emission associated with the molecular accretion disk of NGC 1068. The position angles of the electric polarization vectors are perpendicular to the axes of filamentary structures in the molecular accretion disk. The inferred magnetic field threading the molecular disk must lie within approximately 35 degrees of the sky plane. The orientation of the magnetic fields relative to the disk plane implies that the maser region is unstable to hydromagnetically powered outflow; we speculate that the maser region may be the source of the larger scale molecular outflow found in ALMA studies. The new VLBI observations also reveal a compact radio continuum source, NGC 1068*, aligned with the near-systemic maser spots. The molecular accretion disk must be viewed nearly edge-on, and the revised central mass is (16.6 +/- 0.1) million solar masses.

### Jet from binary neutron star merger with prompt black hole formation

#plasma
### Abstract:
We performed the longest numerical-relativity neutrino-radiation magnetohydrodynamics simulation for a binary neutron star merger that extends to $\approx1.5\mathrm{\,s}$ after the merger. We consider the binary model that undergoes the prompt collapse to a black hole after the merger with asymmetric mass 1.25 $\,M_{\odot}$ and 1.65 $\,M_{\odot}$ and SFHo equation of state. We find the Poynting flux-driven collimated outflow as well as the gravitational wave emission, neutrino emission, dynamical mass ejection, and post-merger mass ejection facilitated by magnetorotational instability-driven turbulent viscosity in a single self-consistent binary neutron star merger simulation. A magnetosphere dominated by the aligned global magnetic field penetrating the black hole develops along the black-hole spin axis after the turbulence in the remnant disk is enhanced. A jet with the Poynting flux with isotropic-equivalent luminosity of $\sim10^{49}\mathrm{\,erg/s}$ is launched, and the duration of the high luminosity is expected to be $O(1)\mathrm{\,s}$ .

### The magnetic field in quiescent star-forming filament G16.96+0.27
**Qi-Lao Gu,Tie Liu,Zhi-Qiang Shen,Sihan Jiao,Julien Montillaud,Mika Juvela,...**


#plasma
### Abstract:
We present 850 {\mu}m thermal dust polarization observations with a resolution of 14.4`(~ 0.13 pc) towards an infrared dark cloud G16.96+0.27 using JCMT/POL-2. The average magnetic field orientation, which roughly agrees with the larger-scale magnetic field orientation traced by the Planck 353 GHz data, is approximately perpendicular to the filament structure. The estimated plane-of-sky magnetic field strength is ~ 96 {\mu}G and ~ 60 {\mu}G using two variants of the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi methods. We calculate the virial and magnetic critical parameters to evaluate the relative importance of gravity, the magnetic field, and turbulence. The magnetic field and turbulence are both weaker than gravity, but magnetic fields and turbulence together are equal to gravity, suggesting that G16.96+0.27 is in a quasi-equilibrium state. The cloud-magnetic-field alignment is found to have a trend moving away from perpendicularity in the dense regions, which may serve as a tracer of potential fragmentation in such quiescent filaments.

### Instant ZeV-ion-acceleration in Upset Magnetar Origin Bursts
**Jiro Shimoda,Tomoki Wada**


#plasma
### Abstract:
We study the energetics of bursting activity in a magnetar under the `Dzhanibekov effect, described by the classical mechanics of rigid bodies. The magnetars rotation axis suddenly flips due to this effect, resulting in a sudden rise of the Euler force. The outer layer of magnetar, called the crust, can plastically flow and eventually break due to the Euler force. Then, the degenerate electrons burst open from the braking region like a balloon burst. We find that the pair plasma formation can be ignited inside the crust, and its radiation can be similar to the observed bursts from soft gamma-ray repeaters. At the beginning of this bursting phenomenon, the self-discharge effect of the electron streaming may induce a strong resistive electric field, accelerating the ions. We also find that the maximum energy of the accelerated ions possibly reaches $\sim$ ZeV within a timescale of $\sim1$ ~ps. If $\gtrsim2$ ~\% of magnetars in nearby galaxies are undergoing this scenario, the observed cosmic-ray flux at $>100$ ~EeV can be explained.

### Solar internetwork magnetic fields... Statistical comparison between observations and MHD simulations
**Elias Ebert,Ivan Milic,Juan Manuel Borrero**


#plasma
### Abstract:
Although the magnetic fields in the quiet Sun account for the majority of the magnetic energy in the solar photosphere, inferring their exact spatial distribution, origin, and evolution poses an important challenge because the signals lie at the limit of todays instrumental precision. This severely hinders and biases our interpretations, which are mostly made through nonlinear model-fitting approaches. Our goal is to directly compare simulated and observed polarization signals in the FeI 630.1 nm and 630.2 nm spectral lines in the solar internetwork. This way, we aim to constrain the mechanism responsible for the generation of the quiet Sun magnetism while avoiding the biases that plague other diagnostic methods. We used three different three-dimensional radiative magneto-hydrodynamic simulations representing different scenarios of magnetic field generation in the internetwork... small-scale dynamo, decay of active regions, and horizontal flux emergence. We synthesized Stokes profiles at different viewing angles and degraded them according to the instrumental specifications of the spectro-polarimeter on the Hinode satellite. Finally, we statistically compared the simulated spectra to the observations at the appropriate viewing angles. The small-scale dynamo simulation reproduced best the statistical properties of the observed polarization signals. This is especially prominent for the disk center viewing geometry, where the agreement is excellent. Moving toward more inclined lines of sight, the agreement worsens slightly. The agreement between the small-scale dynamo simulation and observations at the disk center suggests that small-scale dynamo action plays an important role in the generation of quiet Sun magnetism. However, the magnetic field around 50 km above the photosphere in this simulation does not reproduce observations as well as at the very base of the photosphere.

### Numerical experiments on granulation-generated two-fluid waves and flows in a solar magnetic carpet
**R. Niedziela,K. Murawski,A. K. Srivastava**


#plasma
### Abstract:
We consider the effects of granulation with a complex geometry of a magnetic carpet on the genesis of waves and plasma flows in a quiet-region of the solar atmosphere. Our aim is to perform numerical experiments on the self-generated and self-evolving solar granulation in a magnetic carpet representing the parts of the large-scale magnetized solar atmosphere, where waves and flows are basic inherent physical processes occurring continuously. We perform numerical experiments with the use of the JOANNA code which solves non-ideal and non-adiabatic two-fluid equations for ions+electrons and neutrals treated as two separate fluids. In these experiments, we assume that the plasma is hydrogen, and initially described by magnetohydrostatic equilibrium which is accompanied with a magnetic carpet. Parametric studies with different values of magnetic field show that its higher values result in larger magnitudes of ion-neutral velocity drift, thus ensuring larger heating and plasma flows. The present model addresses that in the highly dynamic solar chromosphere, waves, heating and plasma flows may collectively couple different layers of the solar atmosphere, and this entire process crucially depends on the local plasma and magnetic field properties. We suggest that waves and flows are the natural response of the granulation process in the quiet-Sun.

### Magnetic evolution of active regions... formation and eruption of magnetic flux ropes
**P. Vemareddy**


#plasma
### Abstract:
Magnetic flux ropes (FRs) are twisted structures appearing on the sun, predominantly in the magnetically concentrated regions. These structures appear as coronal features known as filaments or prominences in H $\alpha$ observations, and as sigmoids in X-ray, EUV observations. Using the continuous vector magnetic field observations from \textit{Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager} onboard \textit{Solar Dynamics Observatory}, we study the evolution of the magnetic fields in the active regions (ARs) to understand the conditions of twisted flux formation. While ARs emerge and evolve further, flux motions such as shearing and rotation are efficient mechanisms to form twisted flux ropes. Magnetic helicity quantifies the twisted magnetic fields and helicity injection through photosphere leads to its accumulation in the corona. Therefore, coronal helicity accumulation leads to twisted FR formation and its eruption. The magnetic helicity injection is seen to evolve distinctly in the regions of flux rope formation and eruption. The ARs that are associated with eruptive activity are observed with helicity injection predominantly with one sign over a period of a few days. The ARs that inject helicity with a changing sign are unlikely to form twisted FRs because coronal helicity during the period of one sign of injected helicity gets cancelled by the opposite sign of injection in the later period. As a result, the coronal field reconfigures from shared to potential structure. For a given AR, the upper limit of helicity that could cause a CME eruption is not yet understood, which can be the subject of future studies of ARs. Magnetic reconnection plays a crucial role in both the initiation and driving of FR eruptions after their formation. Data-driven simulations of the AR evolution provide more insights on the flux rope formation and its onset of eruption.

### Formation and Eruption of Hot Channel Magnetic Flux Rope in Nested Double Null Magnetic System
**Surui Yao,Yuandeng Shen,Chengrui Zhou,Dongxu Liu,Xinping Zhou**


#plasma
### Abstract:
The coronal magnetic topology significantly affects the outcome of magnetic flux rope (MFR) eruptions. The recently reported nested double null magnetic system remains unclear as to how it affects MFR eruptions. Using observations from the New Vacuum Solar Telescope and the Solar Dynamics Observatory, we studied the formation and successful eruption of a hot channel MFR from NOAA active region AR12173 on 2014 September 28. We observed that a hot channel MFR formed and erupted as a coronal mass ejection (CME), and the magnetic field of the source region was a nested double null magnetic system in which an inner magnetic null point system was nested by an outer fan-spine magnetic system. Observational analysis suggests that the origin of the MFR was due to magnetic reconnection at the inner null point, which was triggered by the photospheric swirling motions. The long-term shearing motion in the source region throughout around 26 hours might accumulate enough energy to power the eruption. Since previous studies showed that MFR eruptions from nested double null magnetic systems often result in weak jets and stalled or failed eruptions, it is hard to understand the generation of the large-scale CME in our case. A detailed comparison with previous studies reveals that the birth location of the MFR relative to the inner null point might be the critical physical factor for determining whether an MFR can erupt successfully or not in such a particular nested double null magnetic system.

#plasma
### Abstract:
Magnetic fields with strengths ranging from 300 to 500 kG have recently been discovered in a group of four extremely similar helium-enriched hot subdwarf (He-sdO) stars. Besides their strong magnetic fields, these He-sdO stars are characterised by common atmospheric parameters, clustering around $T_\mathrm{eff}$ = 46500K, $\log g$ close to 6, and intermediate helium abundances. Here we present the discovery of three additional magnetic hot subdwarfs, J123359.44-674929.11, J125611.42-575333.45, and J144405.79-674400.93. These stars are again almost identical in terms of atmospheric parameters but, at $B \approx$ 200kG, their magnetic fields are somewhat weaker than those previously known. The close similarity of all known He-sdOs implies a finely-tuned origin. We propose the merging of an He white dwarf with a H+He white dwarf. A differential rotation at the merge interface may initiate a toroidal magnetic field that evolves by a magnetic dynamo to produce a poloidal field. This field is either directly visible at the surface or may diffuse towards the surface if initially buried. We further discuss a broad absorption line centred at about 4630\r{A} that is common to all magnetic He-sdOs. This feature may not be related to the magnetic field but instead to the intermediate helium abundances in these He-sdO stars, allowing the strong He II 4686\r{A} line to be perturbed by collisions with hydrogen atoms.

### Gas phase Elemental abundances in Molecular cloudS (GEMS). X. Observational effects of turbulence on the chemistry of molecular clouds
**L. Beitia-Antero,A. Fuente,D. Navarro-Almaida,A. I. Gomez de Castro,V. Wakelam,P. Caselli,...**


#plasma
### Abstract:
(Abridged) We explore the chemistry of the most abundant C, O, S, and N bearing species in molecular clouds, in the context of the IRAM 30 m Large Programme Gas phase Elemental abundances in Molecular Clouds (GEMS). In this work, we aim to assess the limitations introduced in the observational works when a uniform density is assumed along the line of sight for fitting the observations, developing a very simple numerical model of a turbulent box. We perform a MHD simulation in order to reproduce the turbulent steady-state of a turbulent box with properties typical of a molecular filament before collapse. We post-process the results of the MHD simulation with a chemical code to predict molecular abundances, and then post-process this cube with a radiative transfer code to create synthetic emission maps for a series of rotational transitions observed during the GEMS project. From the chemical point of view, we find that turbulence produces variations on the predicted abundances, but they are more or less critical depending on the chosen transition and the chemical age. When compared to real observations, the results from the turbulent simulation provides a better fit than when assuming a uniform gas distribution along the line of sight. In the view of our results, we conclude that taking into account turbulence when fitting observations might significantly improve the agreement with model predictions. This is especially important for sulfur bearing species that are very sensitive to the variations of density produced by turbulence at early times (0.1 Myr). The abundance of CO is also quite sensitive to turbulence when considering the evolution beyond a few 0.1 Myr.

### Formation of Giant Radio Sources in Galaxy Clusters
**Xiaodong Duan,Linhui Wu,Ruiyu Zhang,Jiawen Li**


#plasma
### Abstract:
The number of observed giant radio sources (GRSs) has increased significantly in recent years, yet their formation mechanisms remain elusive. The discovery of giant radio galaxies within galaxy clusters has further intensified the ongoing debates.We utilize magnetohydrodynamic simulations to investigate the formation of GRSs in cluster environments.To avoid confounding the effects of power and total energy injection, we hold the energy of jet outbursts fixed and study the effect of power by varying the active duration of the jets. Furthermore, we examine the roles of magnetic, thermal, and kinetic energy components by adjusting their fractions in the jets. Additionally, we calculate radio emission for comparison with observations in the radio power-linear size diagram (P-D diagram). We find the lower power-larger bubble effect... lower-power jets tend to produce larger radio sources with fixed total jet energy. Regarding different energy components, jets dominated by toroidal magnetic field energy generate larger radio sources than kinetic and thermal energy-dominated jets. Conversely, strong poloidal magnetic fields hinder radio lobe growth. When injecting $2.06 \times 10^{59}$ erg into a $10^{14}$ solar mass halo, only jets with powers of approximately $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-3}$ Eddington luminosity efficiently traverse the observational region in the P-D diagram. Our findings suggest that energetic, long-lasting (low-power), continuous jets endowed with significant toroidal magnetic fields facilitate the formation of GRSs in cluster environments. However, although the jets with significantly lower power can generate substantially larger radio sources, their faintness may render them unobservable.

### Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays Accelerated by Magnetically Dominated Turbulence
**Luca Comisso,Glennys R. Farrar,Marco S. Muzio**


#plasma
### Abstract:
Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs), particles characterized by energies exceeding $10^{18}$ eV, are generally believed to be accelerated electromagnetically in high-energy astrophysical sources. One promising mechanism of UHECR acceleration is magnetized turbulence. We demonstrate from first principles, using fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations, that magnetically dominated turbulence accelerates particles on a short timescale, producing a power-law energy distribution with a rigidity-dependent, sharply defined cutoff well approximated by the form $f_{\rm cut}\left({E, E_{\rm cut}}\right) = {\text{sech}}\left[ ( {{E}/{E_{\rm cut}}} )^2 \right]$ . Particle escape from the turbulent accelerating region is energy-dependent, with $t_{\rm esc} \propto E^{-\delta} $ and $ \delta \sim 1/3$ . The resulting particle flux from the accelerator follows $dN/dEdt \propto E^{-s} {\text{sech}}\left[ ( {{E}/{E_{\rm cut}}} )^2 \right] $ , with $ s \sim 2.1$ . We fit the Pierre Auger Observatorys spectrum and composition measurements, taking into account particle interactions between acceleration and detection, and show that the turbulence-associated energy cutoff is well supported by the data, with the best-fitting spectral index being $s = 2.1^{+0.06}_{-0.13}$ . Our first-principles results indicate that particle acceleration by magnetically dominated turbulence may constitute the physical mechanism responsible for UHECR acceleration.

### Comparison between the emission torus and the measured toroidal magnetic field for the Crab and Vela nebula
**Wei Deng,Fei Xie,Kuan Liu,Mingyu Ge,Youli Tuo,Fabio La Monaca,...**


#plasma
### Abstract:
Polarization measurements provide insight into the magnetic field, a critical aspect of the dynamics and emission properties around the compact object. In this paper, we present the polarized magnetic field of the Crab outer torus and the Vela arc utilizing Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer observation data. The polarization angle (PA) measured for the Crab outer torus exhibits two monotonic evolutions along the azimuth angle, which are consistent with the normal line of the elliptical ring. There is a slight increase in PA along the azimuth angle for both the inner arc and the outer arc of the Vela nebula. The polarized magnetic vector along the outer torus of the Crab nebula shows the polarized magnetic field aligns with Crab outer torus structure. The PA variation along the Crab outer torus suggests a bulk flow speed of 0.8c. Meanwhile, the Vela nebula polarized magnetic field does not exactly align with the Vela arc structure. We noted that the Crab nebula possesses a polarized toroidal magnetic field, where as the Vela nebula exhibits an incomplete toroidal magnetic field.

### Exact Nonlinear Decomposition of Ideal-MHD Waves Using Eigenenergies II... Fully Analytical EEDM Equations and Pseudo-Advective Energies
**Abbas Raboonik,David Pontin,Lucas Tarr**


#plasma
### Abstract:
Physical insight into plasma evolution in the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) limit can be revealed by decomposing the evolution according to the characteristic modes of the system. In this paper we explore aspects of the eigenenergy decomposition method (EEDM) introduced in an earlier study (Raboonik et al. 2024 , ApJ, 967...80). The EEDM provides an exact decomposition of nonlinear MHD disturbances into their component eigenenergies associated with the slow, Alfv\en, and fast eigenmodes, together with two zero-frequency eigenmodes. Here we refine the EEDM by presenting globally analytical expressions for the eigenenergies. We also explore the nature of the zero-frequency ``pseudo-advective modes in detail. We show that in evolutions with pure advection of magnetic and thermal energy (without propagating waves) a part of the energy is carried by the pseudo advective modes. Exact expressions for the error terms associated with these modes--commonly encountered in numerical simulations--are also introduced. The new EEDM equations provide a robust tool for the exact and unique decomposition of nonlinear disturbances governed by homogeneous quasi-linear partial differential equations, even in the presence of local or global degeneracies.

### Hamiltonian structure of single-helicity, incompressible magnetohydrodynamics and application to magnetorotational instability
**M. Furukawa,M. Hirota**


#plasma
### Abstract:
A four-field reduced model of single helicity, incompressible MHD is derived in cylindrical geometry. An appropriate set of noncanonical variables is found, and the Hamiltonian, the Lie-Poisson bracket and the Casimir invariants are clarified. Detailed proofs of properties of the Lie-Poisson bracket, (i) antisymmetry, (ii) Leibniz rule, and (iii) Jacobi identity, are given. Two applications are presented... the first is that the local dispersion relation of axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamics (MRI) is properly reproduced, and the second is that linear stability analyses including negative-energy MRI were successfully performed.

### Instability in supernova fallback disks and its effect on the formation of ultra long period pulsars
**Hao-Ran Yang,Xiang-Dong Li,Shi-Jie Gao,Kun Xu**


#plasma
### Abstract:
Several pulsars with unusually long periods were discovered recently, comprising a potential population of ultra long period pulsars (ULPPs). The origin of their long periodicity is not well understood, but may be related to magnatars spun down by surrounding fallback disks. While there are few systematic investigations on the fallback disk-assisted evolution of magnetars, the instability in the disk has received little attention, which determines the lifetime of the disk. In this work we simulate the evolution of the magnetic field, spin period, and magnetic inclination angle of magnetars with a supernova fallback disk. We find that thermal viscous instability in the disk could significantly affect the formation of ULPPs. Our simulation results also reveal that a large fraction of ULPPs seem to be nearly aligned and orthogonal rotators. This might help place ULPPs above the death line in the pulse period - period derivative plane. However, some extra mechanisms seem to be required to account for radio emission of ULPPs.

### Systematic 2.5 D resistive MHD simulations with ambipolar diffusion and Hall effect for fast magnetic reconnection
**Gabriela Landinez,Fabio D. Lora-Clavijo**


#plasma
### Abstract:
In this work, we explore the possibility of the Hall effect and ambipolar diffusion as a mechanism for fast reconnection. The reconnected flux of our resistive and resistive+Hall simulations replicates the GEM results. Furthermore, we investigate, for the first time, the effect of ambipolar diffusion in the GEM. The reconnected flux of the resistive+ambipolar and resistive+Hall+ambipolar simulations showed increases of up to 75\% and 143\%, respectively, compared to the resistive and resistive+Hall simulations, showing that ambipolar diffusion contributes significantly to the reconnected flux. Our second scenario has a magnetic Harris field without perturbations but with an out-of-plane component, known as a guide field. We found that the reconnection rate increased faster with ambipolar diffusion, reaching values close to 0.1 for the resistive+Hall+ambipolar simulation followed by the resistive+Hall. These two simulations achieved the highest kinetic energy, implying more efficient energy conversion during reconnection.

### Local stability of differential rotation in magnetised radiation zones and the solar tachocline
**Robert W. Dymott,Adrian J. Barker,Chris A. Jones,Steven M. Tobias**


#plasma
### Abstract:
We study local magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) instabilities of differential rotation in magnetised, stably-stratified regions of stars and planets using a Cartesian Boussinesq model. We consider arbitrary latitudes and general shears (with gravity direction misaligned from this by an angle $\phi$ ), to model radial ( $\phi=0$ ), latitudinal ( $\phi=\pm 90^\circ$ ), and mixed differential rotations, and study both non-diffusive (including magnetorotational, MRI, and Solberg-H{\o}iland instabilities) and diffusive instabilities (including Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke, GSF, and MRI with diffusion). These instabilities could drive turbulent transport and mixing in radiative regions, including the solar tachocline and the cores of red giant stars, but their dynamics are incompletely understood. We revisit linear axisymmetric instabilities with and without diffusion and analyse their properties in the presence of magnetic fields, including deriving stability criteria and computing growth rates, wavevectors and energetics, both analytically and numerically. We present a more comprehensive analysis of axisymmetric local instabilities than prior work, exploring arbitrary differential rotations and diffusive processes. The presence of a magnetic field leads to stability criteria depending upon angular velocity rather than angular momentum gradients. We find MRI operates for much weaker differential rotations than the hydrodynamic GSF instability, and that it typically prefers much larger lengthscales, while the GSF instability is impeded by realistic strength magnetic fields. We anticipate MRI to be more important for turbulent transport in the solar tachocline than the GSF instability when $\phi>0$ in the northern (and vice versa in the southern) hemisphere, though the latter could operate just below the convection zone when MRI is absent for $\phi<0$ .

### Anisotropic thermal conduction on a moving mesh for cosmological simulations
**Rosie Y. Talbot,Rudiger Pakmor,Christoph Pfrommer,Volker Springel,Maria Werhahn,Rebekka Bieri,...**


#plasma
### Abstract:
In weakly collisional, strongly magnetised plasmas such as the intracluster medium (ICM), hot accretion flows and the solar corona, the transport of heat and momentum occurs primarily along magnetic field lines. In this paper we present a new scheme for modelling anisotropic thermal conduction which we have implemented in the moving mesh code AREPO. Our implementation uses a semi-implicit time integration scheme which works accurately and efficiently with individual timestepping, making the scheme highly suitable for use in cosmological simulations. We apply the scheme to a number of test-problems including the diffusion of a hot patch of gas in a circular magnetic field, the progression of a point explosion in the presence of thermal conduction, and the evolution and saturation of buoyancy instabilities in anisotropically conducting plasmas. We use these idealised tests to demonstrate the accuracy and stability of the solver and highlight the ways in which anisotropic conduction can fundamentally change the behaviour of the system. Finally, we demonstrate the solvers capability when applied to highly non-linear problems with deep timestep hierarchies by performing high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations of a galaxy cluster with conduction. We show that anisotropic thermal conduction can have a significant impact on the temperature distribution of the ICM and that whistler suppression may be relevant on cluster scales. The new scheme is, therefore, well suited for future work which will explore the role of anisotropic thermal conduction in a range of astrophysical contexts including the ICM of clusters and the circumgalactic medium of galaxies.

### Energetic Particles from Quasi-Separatrix Layers and Current Sheets at the Sun
**Nathan A. Schwadron,Ronald M. Caplan,Jon A. Linker,Erika Palmerio,Matthew A. Young**


#plasma
### Abstract:
Quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs) at the Sun are created from regions where channels of open magnetic flux have footpoints near regions of large-scale closed magnetic flux. These regions are particularly prone to magnetic reconnection at the Sun. In recent simulations of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) with the Magnetohydrodynamic Algorithm outside a Sphere (MAS) model coupled to the Energetic Particle Radiation Environment Module (EPREM) model, common sources of energetic particles were discovered over broad longitudinal distributions in the background solar wind, far from the sites of particle acceleration driven by compressions and shocks in front of CMEs. Further investigation revealed these to be accelerated energetic particles from the QSLs and current sheets. The energy released from magnetic reconnection near the QSL drives reconnection exhausts and field-aligned flows, which in turn accelerate energetic particles. The reconnection process also releases material previously contained within closed magnetic field structures, which are often rich in heavy ions and $^3$ He ions, as corroborated by recent PSP observations. Therefore, the seed populations produced by QSLs are expected to be rich in $^3$ He and heavy ions. Thus, we present the first global model of energetic particles accelerated from QSLs and above current sheets from the Sun. Our results provide a plausible source for seed populations near the Sun, which likely have $^3$ He and heavy ion enhancements. These results aid in the development of predictive solar energetic particle models.

### The radial distribution of radio emission from SN1993J... Magnetic field amplification due to the Rayleigh-Taylor instability
**I. Marti-Vidal,C-I. Bjornsson,M. A. Perez-Torres,P. Lundqvist,J. M. Marcaide**


#plasma
### Abstract:
[SHORTENED VERSION] Observations of radio emission from young core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) allow one to study the history of the pre-supernova stellar wind, trace the density structure of the ejected material, and probe the magnetohydrodynamics that describe the interaction between the two, as the forward shock expands into the circumstellar medium. The radio shell of supernova SN1993J has been observed with very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) for ~20 years, giving one of the most complete pictures of the evolution of a CCSN shock. However, different results about the expansion curve and properties of the radio-emitting structure have been reported by different authors, likely due to systematics in the data calibration and/or model assumptions made by each team. We aim to perform an analysis of the complete set of VLBI observations of SN1993J that accounts for different instrumental and source-intrinsic effects, by exploring the posterior probability distribution of a complete data model, using Markov chains. Our model accounts for antenna calibration effects, as well as different kinds of radio-emission structures for the supernova. The posterior parameter distributions strongly favor a spherical shell-like radio structure with a nonuniform radial intensity profile, with a broad brightness distribution that peaks close to or just above the region where the contact discontinuity is expected to be located. There is clear evidence of a relative widening of the shell width beyond day 2600-3300 after the explosion, due to an increased deceleration of the inner shell boundary. These results suggest a scenario in which the magnetic field is amplified mainly by the Rayleigh-Taylor instability, which emanates from the contact discontinuity. Furthermore, the reverse shock enters a region of the ejecta at around 3000 days, where the density distribution is substantially flatter.

### From spherical stars to disk-like structures... 3D common-envelope evolution of massive binaries beyond inspiral

### Abstract:
Three-dimensional simulations usually fail to cover the entire dynamical common-envelope phase of gravitational wave progenitor systems due to the vast range of spatial and temporal scales involved. We investigated the common-envelope interactions of a $10\,M_\odot$ red supergiant primary star with a black hole and a neutron star companion, respectively, until full envelope ejection ( ${\gtrsim}\,97 \,\mathrm{\%}$ of the envelope mass). We find that the dynamical plunge-in of the systems determines largely the orbital separations of the core binary system, while the envelope ejection by recombination acts only at later stages of the evolution and fails to harden the core binaries down to orbital frequencies where they qualify as progenitors of gravitational-wave-emitting double-compact object mergers. As opposed to the conventional picture of a spherically symmetric envelope ejection, our simulations show a new mechanism... The rapid plunge-in of the companion transforms the spherical morphology of the giant primary star into a disk-like structure. During this process, magnetic fields are amplified, and the subsequent transport of material through the disk around the core binary system drives a fast jet-like outflow in the polar directions. While most of the envelope material is lost through a recombination-driven wind from the outer edge of the disk, about $7\,\mathrm{\%}$ of the envelope leaves the system via the magnetically driven outflows. We further explored the potential evolutionary pathways of the post-common-envelope systems given the expected remaining lifetime of the primary core ( $2.97\,M_\odot$ ) until core collapse ( $6{\times}10^{4}\,\mathrm{yr}$ ), most likely forming a neutron star. We find that the interaction of the core binary system with the circumbinary disk increases the likelihood of giving rise to a double-neutron star merger. (abridged)

### Multi-messenger signatures of a deformed magnetar in gamma-ray bursts
**Parisa Hashemi,Soroush Shakeri,Yu Wang,Liang Li,Rahim Moradi**


#plasma
### Abstract:
We study the evolution of a newly formed magnetized neutron-star (NS) as a power source of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) in the light of both gravitational wave (GW) and electromagnetic (EM) radiations. The compressible and incompressible fluids are employed in order to model the secular evolution of Maclaurian spheroids. It is shown that the GW and EM light curves evolve as a function of eccentricity and rotational frequency with time. We find that the light curve characteristics crucially depend on NS parameters such as magnitude and structure of magnetic field, ellipticity and the equation of state (EOS) of the fluid. The presence of X-ray flares, whose origins are not yet well understood, can be captured in our model regarding some specific nuclear EOSs. Our model allowing us to explain flares that occur within the wide range of $ 10$ to $10^4$ seconds and the peak luminosity in the order of $10^{46}$ - $10^{51}$ $\rm \text{erg}/s$ by using a reasonable set of parameters such as magnetic field strength around $10^{14}-10^{16}$ Gauss, the quadrupole to dipole ratio of magnetic field up to 500. By applying our model to a sample of GRB X-ray flares observed by Swift/XRT, we try to constraint the crucial parameters of a deformed magnetar via MCMC fitting method. Our analysis shows that ongoing and upcoming joint multi-messenger detections can be used to understand the nature of GRBs central engine and its evolution at the early times of the burst formation.

### Shear-driven magnetic buoyancy in the solar tachocline... Dependence of the mean electromotive force on diffusivity and latitude
**Craig D. Duguid,Paul J. Bushby,Toby S. Wood**


#plasma
### Abstract:
The details of the dynamo process that is responsible for driving the solar magnetic activity cycle are still not fully understood. In particular, whilst differential rotation provides a plausible mechanism for the regeneration of the toroidal (azimuthal) component of the large-scale magnetic field, there is ongoing debate regarding the process that is responsible for regenerating the Suns large-scale poloidal field. Our aim is to demonstrate that magnetic buoyancy, in the presence of rotation, is capable of producing the necessary regenerative effect. Building upon our previous work, we carry out numerical simulations of a local Cartesian model of the tachocline, consisting of a rotating, fully compressible, electrically conducting fluid with a forced shear flow. An initially weak, vertical magnetic field is sheared into a strong, horizontal magnetic layer that becomes subject to magnetic buoyancy instability. By increasing the Prandtl number we lessen the back reaction of the Lorentz force onto the shear flow, maintaining stronger shear and a more intense magnetic layer. This in turn leads to a more vigorous instability and a much stronger mean electromotive force, which has the potential to significantly influence the evolution of the mean magnetic field. These results are only weakly dependent upon the inclination of the rotation vector, i.e. the latitude of the local Cartesian model. Although further work is needed to confirm this, these results suggest that magnetic buoyancy in the tachocline is a viable poloidal field regeneration mechanism for the solar dynamo.

### Angular Power Spectrum of TeV-PeV Cosmic Ray Anisotropies
**Wenyi Bian,Gwenael Giacinti,Brian Reville**


#plasma
### Abstract:
Simulations of the cosmic-ray (CR) anisotropy down to TeV energies are presented, using turbulence parameters consistent with those inferred from observations of the interstellar medium. We compute the angular power spectra $C_{\ell}$ of the CR anisotropy obtained from the simulations. We demonstrate that the amplitude of the large scale gradient in the CR density profile affects only the overall normalisation of the $C_{\ell}$ s, without affecting the shape of the angular power spectrum. We show that the power spectrum depends on CR energy, and that it is sensitive to the location of the observer at small $\ell$ . It is found to flatten at large $\ell$ , and can be modelled by a broken power-law, exhibiting a break at $\ell \approx 4$ . Our computed power spectrum at $\sim 10\,$ TeV fits well HAWC and IceCube measurements. Moreover, we calculate all coefficients of the spherical harmonics and compute the component of the angular power spectrum projected onto the direction of the local magnetic field line. We find that deviations from gyrotropy become increasingly important at higher CR energies and larger values of $\ell$ .

### An acceleration-radiation model for nonthermal flares from Sgr A $^\star$
**Maria Petropoulou,Gabriele Ponti,Giovanni Stel,Apostolos Mastichiadis**


#plasma
### Abstract:
(Abridged) Sgr A $^\star$ is the electromagnetic counterpart of the accreting supermassive black hole in the Galactic center. Its emission is variable in the near-infrared (NIR) and X-ray wavelengths on short timescales. The physical origin of NIR and X-ray flares is still under debate. We introduce a model for the production of NIR and X-ray flares from an active region in Sgr A $^\star$ , where particle acceleration takes place intermittently. In contrast to other radiation models for Sgr A $^\star$ flares, the particle acceleration is not assumed to be instantaneous. We studied the evolution of the particle distribution and the emitted electromagnetic radiation from the flaring region by numerically solving the kinetic equations for electrons and photons. Our calculations took the finite duration of particle acceleration, radiative energy losses, and physical escape from the flaring region into account. To gain better insight into the relation of the model parameters, we complemented our numerical study with analytical calculations. Flares are produced when the acceleration episode has a finite duration. The rising part in the light curve of a flare is related to the particle acceleration timescale, while the decay is controlled by the cooling or escape timescale of particles. Bright X-ray flares, such as the one observed in 2014, have $\gamma$ -ray counterparts that might be detected by the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory. Our model for NIR and X-ray flares favors an interpretation of diffusive nonresonant particle acceleration in magnetized turbulence. If direct acceleration by the reconnection electric field in macroscopic current sheets causes the energization of particles during flares in Sgr A $^\star$ , then models considering the injection of preaccelerated particles into a blob where particles cool and/or escape would be appropriate to describe the flare.

### Discovery of a 25 parsec-long precessing jet emanating from the old nova GK Persei
**Michael M. Shara,Kenneth M. Lanzetta,James T. Garland,David Valls-Gabaud,Stefan Gromoll,Mikita Misiura,...**


#plasma
### Abstract:
Classical nova eruptions result from thermonuclear-powered runaways in, and ejection of, the hydrogen-rich envelopes of white dwarf stars accreted from their close binary companions. Novae brighten to up to 1,000,000 solar luminosities, and recur thousands of times over their lifetimes spanning several billion years. Between eruptions, mass transfer from the donor star to the white dwarf proceeds via an accretion disk unless the white dwarf possesses a strong magnetic field which can partially or totally disrupt the disk. In that case, accretion is focussed by the white dwarfs magnetic field towards its magnetic poles. Optical spectroscopy and interferometric radio maps demonstrate the presence of bipolar jets, typically arcsec in angular size, and orders of magnitude smaller than one parsec in linear size, during the days to months after nova eruptions. These jets expel collimated matter from the white dwarfs in nova binary stars, but well-resolved images of them are lacking. Here we report the Condor telescopes detection of a hitherto unknown, highly resolved and braided jet, three degrees (at least 25 parsecs) in length. The jet originates at the white dwarf of the old nova GK Persei (nova Per 1901 CE). It precesses on a ~ 3600 yr timescale, and must be at least 7200 years old. Detected across four decades of wavelength, the jets ultimate energy source is likely the strong accretion shocks near the white dwarfs magnetic poles.

### Identifying the Growth Phase of Magnetic Reconnection using Pressure-Strain Interaction
**M. Hasan Barbhuiya,Paul A. Cassak,Alex Chasapis,Michael A. Shay,Giulia Cozzani,Alessandro Retino**


#plasma
### Abstract:
Magnetic reconnection often initiates abruptly and then rapidly progresses to a nonlinear quasi-steady state. While satellites frequently detect reconnection events, ascertaining whether the system has achieved steady-state or is still evolving in time remains challenging. Here, we propose that the relatively rapid opening of reconnection separatrices within the electron diffusion region (EDR) serves as an indicator of the growth phase of reconnection. The opening of the separatrices is produced by electron flows diverging away from the neutral line downstream of the X-line and flowing around a dipolarization front. This flow pattern leads to characteristic spatial structures in pressure-strain interaction that could be a useful indicator for the growth phase of a reconnection event. We employ two-dimensional particle-in-cell numerical simulations of anti-parallel magnetic reconnection to validate this prediction. We find that the signature discussed here, alongside traditional reconnection indicators, can serve as a marker of the growth phase. This signature is potentially accessible using multi-spacecraft single-point measurements, such as with NASAs Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) satellites in Earths magnetotail. Applications to other settings where reconnection occurs are also discussed.

### Reversals of toroidal magnetic field in local shearing box simulations of accretion disc with a hot corona
**Nishant K. Singh,Arunima Ajay,S R Rajesh**


#plasma
### Abstract:
Presence of a hot corona above the accretion disc can have important consequences for the evolution of magnetic fields and the Shakura-Sunyaev (SS) viscosity parameter $\alpha$ in such a strongly coupled system. In this work, we have performed three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical shearing-box numerical simulations of accretion disc with a hot corona above the cool disc. Such a two-layer, piece-wise isothermal system is vertically stratified under linear gravity and initial conditions here include a strong azimuthal magnetic field with a ratio between the thermal and magnetic pressures being of order unity in the disc region. Instabilities in this magnetized system lead to the generation of turbulence, which, in turn, governs the further evolution of magnetic fields in a self-sustaining manner. Remarkably, the mean toroidal magnetic field undergoes a complete reversal in time by changing its sign, and it is predominantly confined within the disc. This is a rather unique class of evolution of the magnetic field which has not been reported earlier. Solutions of mean magnetic fields here are thus qualitatively different from the vertically migrating dynamo waves that are commonly seen in previous works which model a single layer of an isothermal gas. Effective $\alpha$ is found to have values between 0.01 and 0.03. We have also made a comparison between models with Smagorinsky and explicit schemes for the kinematic viscosity ( $\nu$ ). In some cases with an explicit $\nu$ we find a burst-like temporal behavior in $\alpha$ .

### The effects of resistivity on oscillatory reconnection and consequences for solar flare Quasi Periodic Pulsations
**Luiz A. C. A. Schiavo,James Stewart,Philippa K. Browning**


#plasma
### Abstract:
Quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) are often observed in flare emissions. While these may reveal much about the time-dependent reconnection involved in flare energy release, the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. In this paper, we use 2D magnetohydrodynamic simulations to investigate the magnetic reconnection in two merging flux ropes, focusing on the effects of the resistivity on the time variation of the reconnection. We consider both uniform resistivity and current-dependent anomalous resistivity profiles. Our findings reveal that resistivity plays a critical role in controlling the reconnection dynamics, including reconnection rate oscillations and the rate of decay of the reconnection rate. Resistivity also influences the oscillations in emitted gyrosynchrotron radiation. However, in contrast to this strong influence of resistivity on reconnection rates, we observed a different behaviour for the emitted waves, whose frequencies are almost independent of resistivity variations.

### Photon conversion to axions and dark photons in magnetized plasmas... a finite-temperature field theory approach
**Nirmalya Brahma,Katelin Schutz**


#plasma
### Abstract:
Some of the most stringent constraints on physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM) arise from considerations of particle emission from astrophysical plasmas. However, many studies assume that particle production occurs in an isotropic plasma environment. This condition is rarely (if ever) met in astrophysical settings, for instance due to the ubiquitous presence of magnetic fields. In anisotropic plasmas, the equations of motion are not diagonal in the usual polarization basis of transverse and longitudinal modes, causing a mixing of these modes and breaking the degeneracy in the dispersion relation of the two transverse modes. This behavior is captured by a $3\times3$ mixing matrix $\pi^{IJ}$ , determined by projecting the response tensor of the plasma $\Pi^{\mu\nu}$ into mode space, whose eigenvectors and eigenvalues are related to the normal modes and their dispersion relations. In this work, we provide a general formalism for determining the normal modes of propagation that are coupled to axions and dark photons in an anisotropic plasma. As a key part of this formalism, we present detailed derivations of $\Pi^{\mu\nu}$ for magnetized plasmas in the long-wavelength limit using the real-time formalism of finite-temperature field theory. We provide analytic approximations for the normal modes and their dispersion relations assuming various plasma conditions that are relevant to astrophysical environments. These approximations will allow for a systematic exploration of the effects of plasma anisotropy on BSM particle production.

### Effect of Magnetic Field on the Formation of Radiatively Inefficient Accretion Flow around Black Holes
**Anish Sarkar,Mayukh Pahari**


#plasma
### Abstract:
We study the effects of magnetic field in the formation of a radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) in the presence of Bremsstrahlung cooling, which facilitates the formation of a geometrically thin, optically thick accretion disk surrounded by a hot corona. We have performed axis-symmetric magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of an initial accretion torus with a $1/r$ dependant local poloidal field in the presence of a pseudo-Newtonian potential, taking into account optically thin cooling, resistivity and viscosity. We observe the formation of persistent jets and magnetised outflows from the corona surrounding a thin disk with an increase in the magnetic diffusivity parameter. We have defined an equivalent time scale ( $\tau_{eq}$ ) which takes into account the heating time scales due to viscosity, resistivity, magnetic reconnection and magneto-rotational instability turbulence such that the thin disk is formed if the cooling time scale ( $\tau_{cool}$ ) is lower than this equivalent time scale ( $\tau_{cool}/\tau_{eq}<1$ ). Using this condition, for the first time, we found that the thin disk exists when the initial ratio of plasma pressure to magnetic pressure (plasma beta) exceeds a range of $600-800$ for the gas obeying a polytropic equation of state accreting at $10^{-5}\ M_{\odot}/year$

### Magnetic reconnection-driven energization of protons up to 400 keV at the near-Sun heliospheric current sheet
**M. I. Desai,J. F. Drake,T. Phan,Z. Yin,M. Swisdak,D. J. McComas,...**


#plasma
### Abstract:
We report observations of direct evidence of energetic protons being accelerated above ~400 keV within the reconnection exhaust of a heliospheric current sheet (HCS) crossing by NASAs Parker Solar Probe (PSP) at a distance of ~16.25 solar radii (Rs) from the Sun. Inside the extended exhaust, both the reconnection-generated plasma jets and the accelerated protons propagated toward the Sun, unambiguously establishing their origin from HCS reconnection sites located beyond PSP. Within the core of the exhaust, PSP detected stably trapped energetic protons up to ~400 keV, which is approximately 1000 times greater than the available magnetic energy per particle. The differential energy spectrum of the accelerated protons behaved as a pure power-law with spectral index of about -5. Supporting simulations using the kglobal model suggest that the trapping and acceleration of protons up to ~400 keV in the reconnection exhaust is likely facilitated by merging magnetic islands with a guide field between ~0.2-0.3 of the reconnecting magnetic field, consistent with the observations. These new results, enabled by PSPs proximity to the Sun, demonstrate that magnetic reconnection in the HCS is a significant new source of energetic particles in the near-Sun solar wind. The discovery of in-situ particle acceleration via magnetic reconnection at the HCS provides valuable insights into this fundamental process which frequently converts the large magnetic field energy density in the near-Sun plasma environment and may be responsible for heating the suns atmosphere, accelerating the solar wind, and energizing charged particles to extremely high energies in solar flares.

### Abstract:
In this paper, we present three-dimensional (3D) Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations to study the stability of 2D Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal (BGK) modes in a magnetized plasma with a finite background magnetic field. The simulations were performed using the Plasma Simulation Code (PSC) [Germaschewski et al., J. of Comp. Phys. 318, 305 (2016)], as in our recent study using 2D PIC simulations [McClung et al., Phys. Plasmas 31, 042302 (2024)], in order to see if and how the previous results would change with 3D effects. We found that solutions that are stable (unstable) in 2D simulations are still stable (unstable) in the new 3D simulations. However, the instability develops slower in 3D than in 2D and forms an unstable spiral wave structure that is in-phase along the axial direction. We have also simulated cases with an electron density bump (EDB) at the center, in addition to cases with an electron density hole (EDH) considered in our previous study, and found differences in the unstable spiral wave structures between the two cases. Additionally, we have generalized our simulations to have an increased electron thermal velocity, as well as using initial conditions solved from the complete Vlasov-Maxwell system of equations. We found that these generalizations did not change the overall behavior of the simulations and the instability that evolves.

### Multi-messenger signature of cosmic rays from the microquasar V4641 Sgr propagating along a Galactic Magnetic Field line
**Andrii Neronov,Foteini Oikonomou,Dmitri Semikoz**


#plasma
### Abstract:
The recently detected extended, very-high-energy gamma-ray emission from the microquasar V4641 Sgr reveals a puzzling 200-parsec-long jet-like structure significantly misaligned with its radio jet. We propose that this gamma-ray structure is produced by high-energy cosmic-ray particles escaping from the microquasar along ordered field lines of the Galactic Magnetic Field and interacting with the interstellar medium. We show that if the gamma-ray emission is produced by interactions of high-energy cosmic ray nuclei, the system is detectable by future multi-km3 neutrino detectors. We argue that gamma-ray observations of jet-like features adjacent to high-energy sources in the Milky Way provide a new method to measure the regular and turbulent components of the Galactic magnetic field at different locations in the Milky Way.

### The effect of data-driving and relaxation model on magnetic flux rope evolution and stability
**Andreas Wagner,Daniel J. Price,Slava Bourgeois,Farhad Daei,Jens Pomoell,Stefaan Poedts,...**


#plasma
### Abstract:
We investigate the effect of data-driving on flux rope eruptivity in magnetic field simulations by analysing fully data-driven modelling results of active region (AR) 12473 and AR11176, as well as preforming relaxation runs for AR12473 (found to be eruptive). Here, the driving is switched off systematically at different time steps. We analyse the behaviour of fundamental quantities, essential for understanding the eruptivity of magnetic flux ropes (MFRs). The data-driven simulations are carried out with the time-dependent magnetofrictional model (TMFM) for AR12473 and AR11176. For the relaxation runs, we employ the magnetofrictional method (MFM) and a zero-beta magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model to investigate how significant the differences between the two relaxation procedures are when started from the same initial conditions. To determine the eruptivity of the MFRs, we calculate characteristic geometric properties, such as the cross-section, MFR height along with stability parameters, such as MFR twist and the decay index. For eruptive cases, we investigate the effect of sustained driving beyond the point of eruptivity on the MFR properties. We find that the fully-driven AR12473 MFR is eruptive while the AR11176 MFR is not. For the relaxation runs, we find that the MFM MFRs are eruptive when the driving is stopped around the flare time or later, while the MHD MFRs show eruptive behaviour even if the driving is switched off one and a half days before the flare occurs. We find that characteristic MFR properties can vary greatly even for the eruptive cases of different relaxation simulations. The results suggest that data driving can significantly influence the evolution of the eruption, with differences appearing even when the relaxation time is set to later stages of the simulation when the MFRs have already entered an eruptive phase.

### In-situ observations of the three-dimensional energy cascade rate and Yaglom flux in the Earths magnetosheath
**Francesco Pecora**


#plasma
### Abstract:
Measuring the energy cascade rate in space plasmas is a challenging task for several reasons. This quantity is (i) inherently three-dimensional (ii) scale-dependent, (iii) anisotropic in the interplanetary plasma, and (iv) requires measurements of plasma parameters in at least four points. Here, we show how three of such problems have been addressed by applying the novel Lag Polyhedra Derivative Ensemble (LPDE) technique to the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission in the Earths magnetosheath.

### Magnetic connectivity from the Sun to the Earth with MHD models I. Impact of the magnetic modelling for connectivity validation
**Silke Kennis,Barbara Perri,Stefaan Poedts**


#plasma
### Abstract:
This article discusses the magnetic connectivity between the Sun and the Earth, which is essential for understanding solar wind and space weather events. Due to limited direct observations, reliable simulations are necessary. The most commonly used method is the two-step ballistic method, but it has many free parameters that affect the results. The authors propose a method based on self-consistent magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models. They combine the COCONUT coronal model with the EUHFORIA heliospheric model to compute magnetic field lines from the Earth to the Sun and quantify spatial and temporal uncertainties. To validate their method, they analyze four events associated with high-speed streams from well-identified coronal holes. The results show partial overlap with the assumed coronal holes of origin, ranging from 19% to 100% depending on the event. They also examine the magnetic polarity observed on Earth, finding that MHD simulations provide a good polarity estimation, with agreement ranging from 36% to 69% across the events. Spatial and temporal uncertainties explain the mixed results for some cases. MHD models appear more effective during periods of maximum solar activity due to the latitudinal extent of the heliospheric current sheet (HCS). The authors conclude that MHD models offer results as good as the two-step ballistic method, with potential for improvement as more critical physics are integrated into the models.

### AI Justification:
The paper focuses on the use of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models to explore magnetic connectivity between the Sun and Earth, which aligns with your interest in “the complex, multi-scale dynamics of magnetic fields in plasma environments.” Moreover, the examination of magnetic polarity and validation of MHD methods highlight the relevance of magnetic dynamics, though it primarily concentrates on solar and heliospheric scales rather than the interstellar medium's dynamics that you are particularly interested in.

### Increased Burstiness at High Redshift in Multi-Physics Models Combining Supernova Feedback, Radiative Transfer and Cosmic Rays
**Tibor Dome,Sergio Martin-Alvarez,Sandro Tacchella,Yuxuan Yuan,Debora Sijacki**


#plasma
### Abstract:
We study star formation variability, or burstiness, as a method to constrain and compare different galaxy formation models at high redshift using the Azahar simulation suite. The models range from magneto-hydrodynamics with a magneto-thermo-turbulent prescription for star formation (iMHD) to more sophisticated setups incorporating radiative transfer (RTiMHD) and cosmic ray physics (RTnsCRiMHD). Analysing a sample of galaxies at redshifts $z=4-10$ , we find that the RTnsCRiMHD model exhibits more regular star formation periodicity compared to iMHD and RTiMHD, as revealed by the Lomb-Scargle periodogram. While the RTiMHD model captures a notable degree of stochasticity in star formation without cosmic rays, RTnsCRiMHD galaxies display even greater scatter in the burst intensity and in the scatter around the star-forming main sequence. To evaluate the burstiness in RTnsCRiMHD against observations, we generate a mock spectrum during a mini-quenching event at $z=7.5$ . This spectrum aligns well with the low-mass quiescent galaxy JADES-GS-z7-01-QU observed at $z=7.3$ , though some discrepancies attributed to stellar metallicity hint at a composite spectrum. Our findings highlight the importance of including complex physical processes like cosmic rays and radiative transfer in simulations to accurately capture the bursty nature of star formation in high-redshift galaxies. Future JWST observations, particularly regarding the scatter around the star-forming main sequence, have the potential to refine and guide the next generation of galaxy formation models.

### SILCC -- VIII... The impact of far-ultraviolet radiation on star formation and the interstellar medium
**Tim-Eric Rathjen,Stefanie Walch,Thorsten Naab,Pierre Nurnberger,Richard Wunsch,Daniel Seifried,...**


#plasma
### Abstract:
We present magnetohydrodynamic simulations of star formation in the multiphase interstellar medium to quantify the impact of non-ionising far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation. This study is carried out within the framework of the \textsc{Silcc Project}. It incorporates the radiative transfer of ionising radiation and self-consistent modelling of variable FUV radiation from star clusters. Near young star clusters, the interstellar radiation field (ISRF) can reach values of $G_0 \approx 10^4$ (in Habing units), far exceeding the canonical solar neighbourhood value of $G_0 = 1.7$ . However, our findings suggest that FUV radiation has minimal impact on the integrated star formation rate compared to other feedback mechanisms such as ionising radiation, stellar winds, and supernovae. Only a slight decrease in star formation burstiness, related to increased photoelectric heating efficiency by the variable FUV radiation field, is detectable. Dust near star-forming regions can be heated up to 60 K via the photoelectric (PE) effect, showing a broad temperature distribution. PE heating rates for variable FUV radiation models show higher peak intensities but lower average heating rates than static ISRF models. Simulations of solar neighbourhood conditions without stellar winds or ionising radiation but with self-consistent ISRF and supernovae show high star formation rates $\sim10^{-1}\,\mathrm{M_\odot\,yr^{-1}\,kpc^{-2}}$ , contradicting expectations. Our chemical analysis reveals increased cold neutral medium volume-filling factors (VFF) outside the vicinity of stellar clusters with a variable ISRF. Simultaneously, the thermally unstable gas is reduced, and a sharper separation of warm and cold gas phases is observed. The variable FUV field also promotes a diffuse molecular gas phase with VFF of $\sim5-10$ ~per cent.

Although the focus on far-ultraviolet radiation and star formation deviates slightly from my primary interest in magnetic field amplification and emergent behaviors, the findings regarding the interactions between the interstellar radiation field and the dynamics of star-forming regions could offer valuable insights into the "force interactions shaping magnetic dynamics."

### Study of Evolution and Geo-effectiveness of CME-CME Interactions using MHD Simulations with SWASTi framework
**Prateek Mayank,Stefan Lotz,Bhargav Vaidya,Wageesh Mishra,D. Chakrabarty**


#plasma
### Abstract:
The geo-effectiveness of Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) is a critical area of study in space weather, particularly in the lesser-explored domain of CME-CME interactions and their geomagnetic consequences. This study leverages the SWASTi framework to perform 3D MHD simulation of a range of CME-CME interaction scenarios within realistic solar wind conditions. The focus is on the dynamics of the initial magnetic flux, speed, density, and tilt of CMEs, and their individual and combined impacts on the disturbance storm time (Dst) index. Additionally, the kinematic, magnetic, and structural impacts on the leading CME, as well as the mixing of both CMEs, are analyzed. Time series in-situ studies are conducted through virtual spacecraft positioned along three different longitudes at 1 AU. Our findings reveal that CME-CME interactions are non-uniform along different longitudes due to the inhomogeneous ambient solar wind conditions. A significant increase in the momentum and kinetic energy of the leading CME is observed due to collisions with the trailing CME, along with the formation of reverse shocks in cases of strong interaction. These reverse shocks lead to complex wave patterns inside CME2, which can prolong the storm recovery phase. Furthermore, we observed that the minimum Dst value decreases with an increase in the initial density, tilt, and speed of the trailing CME.

### Modeling Cosmic-Ray Transport... A CRPropa based stochastic differential equation solver
**Lukas Merten,Sophie Aerdker**


#plasma
### Abstract:
We present a new code that significantly extends CRPropas capabilities to model the ensemble averaged transport of charged cosmic rays in arbitrary turbulent magnetic fields. The software is based on solving a set of stochastic differential equations (SDEs). In this work we give detailed instructions to transform a transport equation, usually given as a partial differential equation, into a Fokker-Planck equation and further into the corresponding set of SDEs. Furthermore, detailed tests of the algorithms are done and different sources of uncertainties are compared to each other. So to some extend, this work serves as a technical reference for existing and upcoming work using the new generalized SDE solver based on the CRPropa framework. On the other hand, the new flexibility allowed us to implement first test cases on continuous particle injection and focused pitch angle diffusion. For the latter one we show that focused pitch angle diffusion leads to a drift velocity along the field lines that is defined by the fixed points of the pitch angle diffusion equation.

### Burn Propagation in Magnetized High-Yield Inertial Fusion
**S. T. O'Neill,B. D. Appelbe,A. J. Crilly,C. A. Walsh,D. J. Strozzi,J. D. Moody,...**


#plasma
### Abstract:
Recent experiments at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) have demonstrated ignition for the first time in an inertial confinement fusion (ICF) experiment, a major milestone allowing the possibility of high energy gain through burn propagation. Use of external magnetic fields, applied primarily to reduce thermal losses, could increase hotspot temperature and ease requirements for ignition, opening up the capsule design space for high energy gain. However, this same restriction of thermal transport has the potential to inhibit burn propagation, which is vital in the attainment of high gain. In this work, radiation-magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations carried out using the code Chimera are used to investigate the effect of a pre-imposed magnetic field on ignition and burn propagation. This paper studies the propagation of burn using both an idealized planar model and in fully-integrated 2D MHD simulations of an igniting NIF capsule. A study of magnetised burn propagation in the idealized planar model identifies three regimes of magnetized burn propagation... (1) thermal conduction driven; (2) alpha transport driven; and (3) fully suppressed burn. Simulations of NIF shot N210808 with an applied 40T axial field show clear indication of burn suppression perpendicular to field lines, with rapid burn observed along field lines. Implosion shape is altered by the field, and anisotropic conduction causes significant modification to the rate of ablation during stagnation. These results highlight the fundamental changes to implosion dynamics in high yield magnetized ICF and motivate further study to better optimize future magnetized target designs for high gain.

### Recovery of coronal dimmings
**Giulia M. Ronca,Galina Chikunova,Karin Dissauer,Tatiana Podladchikova,Astrid M. Veronig**


#plasma
### Abstract:
Coronal dimmings are regions of reduced emission in the lower corona, observed after coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and representing their footprints. In order to investigate the long-term evolution of coronal dimming and its recovery, we propose two approaches that focus on both the global and the local evolution of dimming regions... the fixed mask approach and the pixel boxes approach. We present four case studies (September 6, 2011; March 7, 2012; June 14, 2012; and March 8, 2019) in which a coronal dimming is associated with a flare/CME eruption. We identified the dimming region by image segmentation, then restricted the analysis to a specific portion of the dimming and tracked the time evolution of the dimming brightness and area. In addition, we studied the behavior of small subregions inside the dimming area, of about 3x3 pixels, to compare the recovery in different regions of the dimming. Three out of the four cases show a complete recovery 24 hours after the flare/CME eruption. The recovery of the brightness follows a two-step trend, with a steeper and quicker segment followed by a slower one. In addition, some parts of the dimming, which may be core dimmings, are still present at the end of the analysis time and do not recover within 3 days, whereas the peripheral regions (secondary dimmings) show a full recovery. We demonstrate that the primary mechanism for recovery identified in the observations is the expansion of coronal loops into the dimming region, which gradually increase their intensity. Our developed approaches enable the analysis of dimmings alongside these bright structures, revealing different timescales of recovery for core and secondary/twin dimming regions. Combined with magnetic field modeling, these methods lay the foundation for further systematic analysis of dimming recovery and enhance the knowledge gained from already-analyzed events.

This paper is somewhat relevant to my research interests as it discusses coronal dimmings, which are related to magnetic dynamics in plasma, particularly in the context of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and their impacts on magnetic field behaviors. Although the focus is on recovery dynamics following CMEs and specific analysis techniques, the mention of "magnetic field modeling" and interactions within the dimming regions could provide insights into the "interactions between magnetic, gravitational, and thermal forces" that shape magnetic dynamics, aligning partially with my research focus on the behavior of magnetic fields in astrophysical plasmas.

### Mg ii h&k spectra of an enhanced network region simulated with the MURaM-ChE code. Results using 1.5D synthesis
**P. Ondratschek,D. Przybylski,H. N. Smitha,R. Cameron,S. K. Solanki,J. Leenaarts**


#plasma
### Abstract:
The Mg ii h&k lines are key diagnostics of the solar chromosphere. They are sensitive to the temperature, density, and non-thermal velocities in the chromosphere. The average Mg ii h&k line profiles arising from previous 3D chromospheric simulations are too narrow. We study the formation and properties of the Mg ii h&k lines in a model atmosphere. We also compare the average spectrum, peak intensity, and peak separation of Mg ii k with a representative observation taken by IRIS. We use a model based on the recently developed non-equilibrium version of the radiative magneto-hydrodynamics code MURaM, in combination with forward modeling using the radiative transfer code RH1.5D to obtain synthetic spectra. Our model resembles an enhanced network region created by using an evolved MURaM quiet sun simulation and adding a similar imposed large-scale bipolar magnetic field as in the public Bifrost snapshot of a bipolar magnetic feature. The line width and the peak separation of the spatially averaged spectrum of the Mg ii h&k lines from the MURaM simulation are close to a representative observation from the quiet sun which also includes network fields. However, we find the synthesized line width to be still slightly narrower than in the observation. We find that velocities in the chromosphere play a dominant role in the broadening of the spectral lines. While the average synthetic spectrum also shows a good match with the observations in the pseudo continuum between the two emission lines, the peak intensities are higher in the modeled spectrum. This discrepancy may partly be due to the larger magnetic flux density in the simulation than in the considered observations but also due to the 1.5D radiative transfer approximation. Our findings show that strong maximum velocity differences or turbulent velocities in the chromosphere are necessary to reproduce the observed line widths.

### Linear instability in thermally-stratified quasi-Keplerian flows
**Dongdong Wan,Rikhi Bose,Mengqi Zhang,Xiaojue Zhu**


#plasma
### Abstract:
Quasi-Keplerian flow, a special regime of Taylor-Couette co-rotating flow, is of great astrophysical interest for studying angular momentum transport in accretion disks. The well-known magnetorotational instability (MRI) successfully explains the flow instability and generation of turbulence in certain accretion disks, but fails to account for these phenomena in protoplanetary disks where magnetic effects are negligible. Given the intrinsic decrease of the temperature in these disks, we examine the effect of radial thermal stratification on 3-D global disturbances in linearised quasi-Keplerian flows under radial gravitational acceleration mimicking stellar gravity. Our results show a thermohydrodynamic linear instability for both axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric modes across a broad parameter space of the thermally-stratified quasi-Keplerian flow. Generally, decreasing Richardson or Prandtl numbers stabilises the flow, while a reduced radius ratio destabilises it. This work also provides a quantitative characterisation of the instability. At low Prandtl numbers $Pr$ , we observe a scaling relation of the linear critical Taylor number $Ta_c\propto$ $Pr^{-6/5}$ . Extrapolating the observed scaling to high $Ta$ and low $Pr$ may suggest the relevance of the instability to accretion disks. Moreover, even slight thermal stratification, characterised by a low Richardson number, can trigger the flow instability with a small axial wavelength. These findings are qualitatively consistent with the results from a traditional local stability analysis based on short wave approximations. Our study refines the thermally-induced linearly-unstable transition route in protoplanetary disks to explain angular momentum transport in dead zones where MRI is ineffective.

### Multiwavelength Campaign Observations of a Young Solar-type Star, EK Draconis. II. Understanding Prominence Eruption through Data-Driven Modeling and Observed Magnetic Environment

### Abstract:
EK Draconis, a nearby young solar-type star (G1.5V, 50-120 Myr), is known as one of the best proxies for inferring the environmental conditions of the young Sun. The star frequently produces superflares and Paper I presented the first evidence of an associated gigantic prominence eruption observed as a blueshifted H $\alpha$ Balmer line emission. In this paper, we present the results of dynamical modeling of the stellar eruption and examine its relationship to the surface starspots and large-scale magnetic fields observed concurrently with the event. By performing a one-dimensional free-fall dynamical model and a one dimensional hydrodynamic simulation of the flow along the expanding magnetic loop, we found that the prominence eruption likely occurred near the stellar limb (12 $^{+5}_{-5}$ -16 $^{+7}_{-7}$ degrees from the limb) and was ejected at an angle of 15 $^{+6}_{-5}$ -24 $^{+6}_{-6}$ degrees relative to the line of sight, and the magnetic structures can expand into a coronal mass ejection (CME). The observed prominence displayed a terminal velocity of $\sim$ 0 km s $^{-1}$ prior to disappearance, complicating the interpretation of its dynamics in Paper I. The models in this paper suggest that prominences H $\alpha$ intensity diminishes at around or before its expected maximum height, explaining the puzzling time evolution in observations. The TESS light curve modeling and (Zeeman) Doppler Imaging revealed large mid-latitude spots with polarity inversion lines and one polar spot with dominant single polarity, all near the stellar limb during the eruption. This suggests that mid-latitude spots could be the source of the pre-existing gigantic prominence we reported in Paper I. These results provide valuable insights into the dynamic processes that likely influenced the environments of early Earth, Mars, Venus, and young exoplanets.

### Chaotic Propellers of Barred Galaxies and Central Explosions
**Debasish Mondal**


#plasma
### Abstract:
The central theme of this thesis work is to explore the possibilities of spiral arm formations from instabilities formed inside the central region of disc galaxies. These instabilities originate from the central baryonic feedback and have many prospects regarding the evolution of disc galaxies. They can trigger the gravitational collapse inside the dense molecular clouds that lead to the formation of stars under suitable astrophysical circumstances. In the present work, the role of parameters like the molecular clouds magnetic field, rotation, etc., has been investigated behind this explosion-triggered star formation process with the help of Jeans instability analysis. From this study, our essential observation is that the formation of star clusters is favoured by a strong magnetic field ( $\sim 10 \; \mu$ G), and the effect is enhanced at a more considerable distance from the centre. Again, this instability also contributes to the formation of stellar bars. This dense rotating component may drive out the chaotic stellar orbits from the disc through its two ends like a propeller. This process has been modelled in the thesis work from the viewpoint of chaotic scattering in open Hamiltonian systems. This analysis concludes that this bar-driven chaotic motion (or simply escaping motion) may lead to the forming of spiral arms or inner disc rings, depending on the bar strength. Our study also found that, compared to NFW dark haloes, the oblate dark haloes offer a more cohesive evolutionary framework for generating bar-driven escape structures in giant spiral and dwarf galaxies. Moreover, the formation of spiral arms via bar-driven escaping motion is only encouraged in galaxies with NFW dark haloes if they have highly energetic centres, like active galaxies.

### A regularisation technique to precisely infer limb darkening using transit measurements... can we estimate stellar surface magnetic fields?
**Kuldeep Verma,Pierre F. L. Maxted,Anjali Singh,H. -G. Ludwig,Yashwardhan Sable**


#plasma
### Abstract:
The high-precision measurements of exoplanet transit light curves that are now available contain information about the planet properties, their orbital parameters, and stellar limb darkening (LD). Recent 3D magneto-hydrodynamical (MHD) simulations of stellar atmospheres have shown that LD depends on the photospheric magnetic field, and hence its precise determination can be used to estimate the field strength. Among existing LD laws, the uses of the simplest ones may lead to biased inferences, whereas the uses of complex laws typically lead to a large degeneracy among the LD parameters. We have developed a novel approach in which we use a complex LD model but with second derivative regularisation during the fitting process. Regularisation controls the complexity of the model appropriately and reduces the degeneracy among LD parameters, thus resulting in precise inferences. The tests on simulated data suggest that our inferences are not only precise but also accurate. This technique is used to re-analyse 43 transit light curves measured by the NASA Kepler and TESS missions. Comparisons of our LD inferences with the corresponding literature values show good agreement, while the precisions of our measurements are better by up to a factor of 2. We find that 1D non-magnetic model atmospheres fail to reproduce the observations while 3D MHD simulations are qualitatively consistent. The LD measurements, together with MHD simulations, confirm that Kepler-17, WASP-18, and KELT-24 have relatively high magnetic fields ( $>200$ G). This study paves the way for estimating the stellar surface magnetic field using the LD measurements.

### Atmospheric escape in hot Jupiters under sub-Alfvénic interactions
**Andres Presa,Florian A. Driessen,Aline A. Vidotto**


#plasma
### Abstract:
Hot Jupiters might reside inside the Alfv\en surface of their host star wind, where the stellar wind is dominated by magnetic energy. The implications of such a sub-Alfv\enic environment for atmospheric escape are not fully understood. Here, we employ 3-D radiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulations and Lyman- $\alpha$ transit calculations to investigate atmospheric escape properties of magnetised hot Jupiters. By varying the planetary magnetic field strength ( $B_p$ ) and obliquity, we find that the structure of the outflowing atmosphere transitions from a magnetically unconfined regime, where a tail of material streams from the nightside of the planet, to a magnetically confined regime, where material escapes through the polar regions. Notably, we find an increase in the planet escape rate with $B_p$ in both regimes, with a local decrease when the planet transitions from the unconfined to the confined regime. Contrary to super-Alfv\enic interactions, which predicted two polar outflows from the planet, our sub-Alfv\enic models show only one significant polar outflow. In the opposing pole, the planetary field lines connect to the star. Finally, our synthetic Ly- $\alpha$ transits show that both the red-wing and blue-wing absorptions increase with $B_p$ . Furthermore, there is a degeneracy between $B_p$ and the stellar wind mass-loss rate when considering absorption of individual Lyman- $\alpha$ wings. This degeneracy can be broken by considering the ratio between the blue-wing and the red-wing absorptions, as stronger stellar winds result in higher blue-to-red absorption ratios. We show that, by using the absorption ratios, Lyman- $\alpha$ transits can probe stellar wind properties and exoplanetary magnetic fields.

### A New Approach of Data-driven Simulation and Its Application to Solar Active Region 12673
**Zhi-Peng Liu,Chao-Wei Jiang,Xin-Kai Bian,Qing-Jun Liu,Peng Zou,Xue-Shang Feng**


#plasma
### Abstract:
The solar coronal magnetic field is a pivotal element in the study of eruptive phenomena, and understanding its dynamic evolution has long been a focal point in solar physics. Numerical models, driven directly by observation data, serve as indispensable tools in investigating the dynamics of the coronal magnetic field. This paper presents a new approach to electric field inversion, which involves modifying the electric field derived from the DAVE4VM velocity field using ideal Ohms law. The time series of the modified electric field is used as a boundary condition to drive a MHD model, which is applied to simulate the magnetic field evolution of active region 12673. The simulation results demonstrate that our method enhances the magnetic energy injection through the bottom boundary, as compared with energy injection calculated directly from the DAVE4VM code, and reproduce of the evolution of the photospheric magnetic flux. The coronal magnetic field structure is also in morphological similarity to the coronal loops. This new approach will be applied to the high-accuracy simulation of eruption phenomena and provide more details on the dynamical evolution of the coronal magnetic field.

### Magnetorotational neutron star kicks
**Ilya A. Kondratyev,Sergey G. Moiseenko,Gennady S. Bisnovatyi-Kogan**


#plasma
### Abstract:
High velocity neutron stars, observed as rapidly moving radio-pulsars, are believed to gain high linear velocities -- kicks -- in aspherical supernova explosions. The mechanism of the kick formation is probably connected with anisotropic neutrino flash, and/or anisotropic matter ejection. In this paper, we investigate a neutron star kick origin in a magnetorotational (MR) supernova explosion model. The simulations have been done for a series of core collapse supernova models with initial equatorially asymmetric magnetic fields. We have realized 2D magnetohydrodynamic simulations, considering the protoneutron star kick and explosion properties in three different asymmetric magnetic field configurations. The simulations show, that in the MR supernova model protoneutron star kicks are formed with velocities up to ~500 km/s, due to asymmetric matter ejection in jets. It may explain the observed kick velocities of some neutron stars, formed in the MR supernovae explosions.

### The influence of the cloud virial parameter on the initial mass function
**Sajay Sunny Mathew,Christoph Federrath,Amit Seta**


#plasma
### Abstract:
Crucial for star formation is the interplay between gravity and turbulence. The observed cloud virial parameter, $\alpha_{\mathrm{vir}}$ , which is the ratio of twice the turbulent kinetic energy to the gravitational energy, is found to vary significantly in different environments, where the scatter among individual star-forming clouds can exceed an order of magnitude. Therefore, a strong dependence of the initial mass function (IMF) on $\alpha_{\mathrm{vir}}$ may challenge the notion of a universal IMF. To determine the role of $\alpha_{\mathrm{vir}}$ on the IMF, we compare the star-particle mass functions obtained in high-resolution magnetohydrodynamical simulations including jet and heating feedback, with $\alpha_{\mathrm{vir}}=0.0625$ , $0.125$ , and $0.5$ . We find that varying $\alpha_{\mathrm{vir}}$ from $\alpha_{\mathrm{vir}}\sim0.5$ to $\alpha_{\mathrm{vir}}<0.1$ shifts the peak of the IMF to lower masses by a factor of $\sim2$ and increases the star formation rate by a similar factor. The dependence of the IMF and star formation rate on $\alpha_{\mathrm{vir}}$ is non-linear, with the dependence subsiding at $\alpha_{\mathrm{vir}}<0.1$ . Our study shows a systematic dependence of the IMF on $\alpha_{\mathrm{vir}}$ . Yet, it may not be measurable easily in observations, considering the uncertainties, and the relatively weak dependence found in this study.

### Bridging Scales... Coupling the galactic nucleus to the larger cosmic environment
**Kung-Yi Su,Priyamvada Natarajan,Hyerin Cho,Ramesh Narayan,Philip F. Hopkins,Daniel Angles-Alcazar,...**


#plasma
### Abstract:
Coupling black hole (BH) feeding and feedback involves interactions across vast spatial and temporal scales that is computationally challenging. Tracking gas inflows and outflows from kilo-parsec scales to the event horizon for non-spinning BHs in the presence of strong magnetic fields, Cho et al. (2023, 2024) report strong suppression of accretion on horizon scales and low (2%) feedback efficiency. In this letter, we explore the impact of these findings for the supermassive BHs M87* and Sgr A*, using high-resolution, non-cosmological, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations with the Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE-2) model. With no feedback, we find rapid BH growth due to `cooling flows,` and for 2% efficiency feedback, while accretion is suppressed, the rates still remain higher than constraints from Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) data (Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration et al. 2021, 2022) for M87* and Sgr A*. To match EHT observations of M87*, a feedback efficiency greater than 15% is required, suggesting the need to include enhanced feedback from BH spin. Similarly, a feedback efficiency of $>15\%$ is needed for Sgr A* to match the estimated observed star formation rate of $\lesssim 2 {\rm M_\odot}$ yr $^{-1}$ . However, even with 100% feedback efficiency, the accretion rate onto Sgr A* matches with EHT data only on rare occasions in the simulations, suggesting that Sgr A* is likely in a temporary quiescent phase currently. Bridging accretion and feedback across scales, we conclude that higher feedback efficiency, possibly due to non-zero BH spin, is necessary to suppress `cooling flows` and match observed accretion and star formation rates in M87* and Sgr A*.

### Interpolation techniques for reconstructing Galactic Faraday rotation
**Affan Khadir,Ayush Pandhi,Sebastian Hutschenreuter,Bryan Gaensler,Shannon Vanderwoude,Jennifer West,...**


#plasma
### Abstract:
The line-of-sight structure of the Galactic magnetic field (GMF) can be studied using Faraday rotation measure (RM) grids. We analyze how the choice of interpolation kernel can affect the accuracy and reliability of reconstructed RM maps. We test the following kernels... inverse distance weighting (IDW), natural neighbour interpolation (NNI), inverse multiquadric interpolation (IM), thin-plate spline interpolation (TPS), and a Bayesian rotation measure sky (BRMS); all techniques were tested on two simulated Galactic foreground RMs (one assuming the GMF has patchy structures and the other assuming it has filamentary structures) using magnetohydrodynamic simulations. Both foregrounds were sampled to form RM grids with densities of $\sim$ 40 sources deg $^{-2}$ and area $\sim$ 144 deg $^2$ . The techniques were tested on data sets with different noise levels and Gaussian random extragalactic RM contributions. The data set that most closely emulates expected data from current surveys, such as the POlarization Sky Survey of the Universes Magnetism (POSSUM), had extragalactic contributions and a noise standard deviation of $\sim 1.5$ rad m $^{-2}$ . For this data set, the accuracy of the techniques for the patchy structures from best to worst was... BRMS, NNI, TPS, IDW and IM; while in the filamentary simulate foreground it was... BRMS, NNI, TPS, and IDW. IDW is the most computationally expensive technique, while TPS and IM are the least expensive. BRMS and NNI have the same, intermediate computational cost. This analysis lays the groundwork for Galactic RM studies with large radio polarization sky surveys, such as POSSUM.

### Investigating Unusual H $α$ Features towards the Scutum Supershell
**R. Alsulami,S. Einecke,G. P. Rowell,P. K. McGee,M. D. Filipovic,I. R. Seitenzahl,...**


#plasma
### Abstract:
We investigate the unusual H $\alpha$ features found towards the Scutum Supershell via recent arc-minute and arc-second resolution imaging. These multi-degree features resemble a long central spine ending in a bow-shock morphology. We performed a multi-wavelength study in [SII] optical, radio continuum, infrared continuum, HI, CO, X-ray and gamma-ray emissions. Interestingly, we found the Galactic worm GW16.9 $-$ 3.8 HI feature appears within the Scutum Supershell, and likely influences the spine morphology. Furthermore, the rightmost edge of the bow-shock H $\alpha$ emission overlaps with [S II] line emission, 4.85 GHz radio, and both 60 $\mu$ m and 100 $\mu$ m infrared continuum emissions, suggesting some potential for excitation by shock heating. We estimated the photo-ionisation from O-type and B-type stars in the region (including those from the OB associations Ser OB1B, Ser OB2 and Sct OB3) and found that this mechanism could supply the excitation to account for the observed H $\alpha$ luminosity of the spine and bow-shock of $\sim$ 1e36 - 2e36 erg/s (d/2.5 kpc) $^2$ . Recent MHD simulations by Drozdov et al. (2022) demonstrate the potential for supernova events to drive outflow and bow-shock types of features of the same energetic nature and physical scale as the H $\alpha$ emission we observe here. While this clearly requires many supernova events over time, we speculate that one contributing event could have come from the presumably energetic supernova (hypernova) birth of the magnetar tentatively identified in the X-ray binary LS 5039.

### The magnetic topology of AR13664 leading to its first halo CME
**David MacTaggart,Tom Williams,OPM Aslam**


#plasma
### Abstract:
In the first half of May 2024, the solar active region (AR)13664 was responsible for generating the strongest geomagnetic storm in over 20 years, through an enhanced production of X-class flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). A key factor in this production was the complex magnetic topology of AR13664. In this work, we investigate the regions magnetic topology related to the production of its first halo CME on May 8th. This is achieved by combining different observations of magnetic topology based on photospheric magnetic winding signatures and nonlinear force-free extrapolations, together with Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) observations at different wavelengths. We present evidence that the first halo CME, and its associated X1 flare, was created by an emerging bipole of twisted magnetic field, following the general picture of the standard flare model. The coincidence of the first large magnetic winding signature with the start time of the X1 flare, provides the onset time for the CME as well as the period of enhanced eruptive activity of the region - 04...36UT on May 8th. Finally, our topological analysis identifies the key topological sub-regions of AR13664 that can lead to subsequent eruptions, which will be useful for further studies of this region.

### Interaction of the Prominence Plasma within the Magnetic Cloud of an ICME with the Earths Bow Shock
**Hadi Madanian,Li-Jen Chen,Jonathan Ng,Michael J. Starkey,Stephen A. Fuselier,Naoki Bessho,...**


#plasma
### Abstract:
The magnetic cloud within an interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) is characterized by high magnetic field intensities. In this study, we investigate the interaction of a magnetic cloud carrying a density structure with the Earths bow shock during the ICME event on 24 April 2023. Elevated abundances of cold protons and heavier ions, namely alpha particles and singly charged helium ions, associated with the prominence plasma are observed within this structure. The plasma downstream of the bow shock exhibits an irregular compression pattern which could be due to the presence of heavy ions. Heavy ions carry a significant fraction of the upstream flow energy; however, due to their different charge per mass ratio and rigidity, they are less scattered by the electromagnetic and electrostatic waves at the shock. We find that downstream of the shock, while the thermal ion energy is only a small fraction of the background magnetic energy density, nevertheless increased ion fluxes reduce the characteristic wave speeds in the that region. As such, we observe a transition state of an unstable bow shock layer across which the plasma flow is super Alfv\enic in both upstream and downstream regions. Our findings help with understanding the intense space weather impacts of such events.

### Some generalizations of the convective model of jet generation
**S. N. Artekha**


#plasma
### Abstract:
For analytical description of the initial stage of jet generation in nonequilibrium inhomogeneous plasma in the magnetohydrodynamic approximation, possible generalizations of solutions of the nonlinear equation for the stream function are analyzed. The jet generation model is based on the mechanism of convective instability and the frozen-in condition of magnetic field lines and is characterized by a number of free parameters. The equation for the radial part of the stream function is satisfied by first-order Bessel functions. To satisfy all the conditions near the jet axis and on its periphery, the found solutions are smoothly joined at the boundary. The final analytical solution for the velocity field is applicable to arbitrary values of dimensionless coordinates. The poloidal velocity increases approximately exponentially, and the azimuthal velocity - according to a superexponential law. In this paper, the velocity field of the jet, which consists of seven sections, is calculated. The rotation of the jet turns out to be differential, and to obtain a solution in quadratures for the azimuthal velocity, one can use not only linear but also power dependences on the altitude. For the exponent n < 1, a noticeable increase in the azimuthal velocity with radius is observed immediately from the jet axis, and for n > 1, a region of relative calm is observed near the axis. The jet model is generalized to the case of an arbitrary dependence of the Brunt-V\`ais\`al\`a frequency on the altitude. The corresponding solutions are found for the radial and vertical velocity components. For the initial stage of development, the vertical and azimuthal components of the generated magnetic field of the jet were also found in the work.

### Unravelling sub-stellar magnetospheres
**Robert D Kavanagh,Harish K Vedantham,Kovi Rose,Sanne Bloot**


#plasma
### Abstract:
At the sub-stellar boundary, signatures of magnetic fields begin to manifest at radio wavelengths, analogous to the auroral emission of the magnetised solar system planets. This emission provides a singular avenue for measuring magnetic fields at planetary scales in extrasolar systems. So far, exoplanets have eluded detection at radio wavelengths. However, ultracool dwarfs (UCDs), their higher mass counterparts, have been detected for over two decades in the radio. Given their similar characteristics to massive exoplanets, UCDs are ideal targets to bridge our understanding of magnetic field generation from stars to planets. In this work, we develop a new tomographic technique for inverting both the viewing angle and large-scale magnetic field structure of UCDs from observations of coherent radio bursts. We apply our methodology to the nearby T8 dwarf WISE J062309.94-045624.6 (J0623) which was recently detected at radio wavelengths, and show that it is likely viewed pole-on. We also find that J0623s rotation and magnetic axes are misaligned significantly, reminiscent of Uranus and Neptune, and show that it may be undergoing a magnetic cycle with a period exceeding 6 months in duration. These findings demonstrate that our method is a robust new tool for studying magnetic fields on planetary-mass objects. With the advent of next-generation low-frequency radio facilities, the methods presented here could facilitate the characterisation of exoplanetary magnetospheres for the first time.

### AI Justification:
This paper is somewhat relevant to your research interests as it addresses the measurement and dynamics of magnetic fields, albeit at a planetary scale rather than within the interstellar medium. The focus on "magnetic field generation" and the interaction of magnetic properties with rotation and axes may provide insights into "magnetic dynamics of plasmas" which could have broader implications for understanding force interactions, although it falls short of addressing the larger scales or turbulent environments you are primarily focused on.

### Nested active regions anchor the heliospheric current sheet and stall the reversal of the coronal magnetic field
**Adam J. Finley**


#plasma
### Abstract:
During the solar cycle, the Suns magnetic field polarity reverses due to the emergence, cancellation, and advection of magnetic flux towards the rotational poles. Flux emergence events occasionally cluster together, although it is unclear if this is due to the underlying solar dynamo or simply by chance. Regardless of the cause, we aim to characterise how the reversal of the Suns magnetic field and the structure of the solar corona are influenced by nested flux emergence. From the spherical harmonic decomposition of the Suns photospheric magnetic field, we identify times when the reversal of the dipole component stalls for several solar rotations. Using observations from sunspot cycle 23 to present, we locate the nested active regions responsible for each stalling and explore their impact on the coronal magnetic field using potential field source surface extrapolations. Nested flux emergence has a more significant impact on the topology of the coronal magnetic field than isolated emergences as it produces a coherent (low spherical harmonic order) contribution to the photospheric magnetic field. The heliospheric current sheet (HCS), that separates oppositely directed coronal magnetic field, can become anchored above these regions due to the formation of strong opposing magnetic fluxes. Further flux emergence, cancellation, differential rotation, and diffusion, then effectively advects the HCS and shifts the dipole axis. Nested flux emergence can restrict the evolution of the HCS and impede the reversal of the coronal magnetic field. The sources of the solar wind can be more consistently identified around nested active regions as the magnetic field topology remains self-similar for multiple solar rotations. This highlights the importance of identifying nested active regions to guide the remote-sensing observations of modern heliophysics missions.

### AI Justification:
This paper provides valuable insights into "magnetic field polarity reverses" and the role of "nested flux emergence," which aligns with your interest in "magnetic field amplification" and its mechanisms within astrophysical systems. Additionally, the discussion on how "nested active regions" influence the "topology of the coronal magnetic field" speaks to the complex interactions and emergent behaviors of magnetic fields that you are keen to explore in your research.

### Ultrafast dynamics of a spin-polarized electron plasma with magnetic ions
**Benjamin Bakri,Nicolas Crouseilles,Paul-Antoine Hervieux,Xue Hong,Giovanni Manfredi**


#plasma
### Abstract:
We construct a mean-field model that describes the nonlinear dynamics of a spin-polarized electron gas interacting with fixed, positively-charged ions possessing a magnetic moment that evolves in time. The mobile electrons are modeled by a four-component distribution function in the two-dimensional phase space $(x,v)$ , obeying a Vlasov-Poisson set of equations. The ions are modeled by a Landau-Lifshitz equation for their spin density, which contains ion-ion and electron-ion magnetic exchange terms. We perform a linear response study of the coupled Vlasov-Poisson-Landau-Lifshitz (VPLL) equations for the case of a Maxwell-Boltzmann equilibrium, focussing in particular on the spin dispersion relation. Condition of stability or instability for the spin modes are identified, which depend essentially on the electron spin polarization rate $\eta$ and the electron-ion magnetic coupling constant $K$ . We also develop an Eulerian grid-based computational code for the fully nonlinear VPLL equations, based on the geometric Hamiltonian method first developed in [N. Crouseilles et al. Journal of Plasma Physics, 89(2)...905890215, 2023]. This technique allows us to achieve great accuracy for the conserved quantities, such as the modulus of the ion spin vector and the total energy. Numerical tests in the linear regime are in accordance with the estimations of the linear response theory. For two-stream equilibria, we study the interplay of instabilities occurring in both the charge and the spin sectors. The set of parameters used in the simulations, with densities close to those of solids ( $\approx 10^{29} \rm m^{-3}$ ) and temperatures of the order of 10 eV, may be relevant to the warm dense matter regime appearing in some inertial fusion experiments.

### Knot-detection algorithm to measure viscosity in three-dimensional MHD plasmas
**Ratul Chakraborty,Rupak Mukherjee**


#plasma
### Abstract:
This project explores the mathematical study of knots and links in topology, focusing on differentiating between the two-component Unlink and the Hopf Link using a computational tool named LINKAGE. LINKAGE employs the linking number, calculated through Barycentric Equations, Matrix Algebra, and basic topological principles, to quantify the degree of linking between two closed curves in three-dimensional space. This approach not only distinguishes between different knot structures but also has applications in understanding complex systems such as magnetic field lines in plasma physics. Additionally, this project includes an example where multiple interlinked loops were analyzed over different time stamps using the LINKAGE algorithm. By observing how these links break and evolve, the algorithm demonstrates its ability to track changes in the topological properties of the system. This dynamic analysis shows the versatility of the tool in studying evolving systems, where the topology of the components can change, providing valuable information about the underlying physical processes driving these changes.

### Long-Wavelength Limit of the Two-Fluid Euler-Poisson System
**Emily Kelting,J. Douglas Wright**


#plasma
### Abstract:
Plasma is a medium filled with free electrons and positive ions. Each particle acts as a conducting fluid with a single velocity and temperature when electromagnetic fields are present. This distinction between the roles played by electrons and ions is what we refer to as the two $-$ fluid description of plasma. In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of these particles in both hot and cold plasma using a collisionless Euler-Poisson system. Employing analytical and computational techniques from differential equations, we show this system is governed by the dynamics of the Korteweg $-$ de Vries (KdV) equation in the long $-$ wavelength limit.

### Blue large-amplitude pulsators formed from the merger of low-mass white dwarfs
**Piotr A. Kolaczek-Szymanski,Andrzej Pigulski,Piotr Lojko**


#plasma
### Abstract:
Blue large-amplitude pulsators (BLAPs) are a recently discovered group of hot stars pulsating in radial modes. Their origin needs to be explained, and several scenarios for their formation have already been proposed. We investigate whether BLAPs can originate as the product of a merger of two low-mass white dwarfs (WDs) and estimate how many BLAPs can be formed in this evolutionary channel. We used the MESA code to model the merger of three different double extremely low-mass (DELM) WDs and the subsequent evolution of the merger product. We also performed a population synthesis of Galactic DELM WDs using the COSMIC code. We find that BLAPs can be formed from DELM WDs provided that the total mass of the system ranges between 0.32 and 0.7 M $_\odot$ . BLAPs born in this scenario either do not have any thermonuclear fusion at all or show off-centre He burning. The final product evolves to hot subdwarfs and eventually finishes its evolution either as a cooling He WD or a hybrid He/CO WD. The merger products become BLAPs only a few thousand years after coalescence, and it takes them 20 to 70 thousand years to pass the BLAP region. We found the instability of the fundamental radial mode to be in fair agreement with observations, but we also observed instability of the radial first overtone. From the population synthesis, we found that up to a few hundred BLAPs born in this scenario can exist at present in the Galaxy. Given the estimated number of BLAPs formed in the studied DELM WD merger scenario, there is a good chance to observe BLAPs that originated through this scenario. Since strong magnetic fields can be generated during mergers, this scenario could lead to the formation of magnetic BLAPs. This fits well with the discovery of two likely magnetic BLAPs whose pulsations can be explained in terms of the oblique rotator model.

### Deriving the interaction point between a Coronal Mass Ejection and High Speed Stream... A case study
**Akshay Kumar Remeshan,Mateja Dumbovic,Manuela Temmer**


#plasma
### Abstract:
We analyze the interaction between an Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejection (ICME) detected in situ at the L1 Lagrange point on 2016 October 12 with a trailing High-Speed Stream (HSS). We aim to estimate the region in the interplanetary (IP) space where the interaction happened/started using a combined observational-modeling approach. We use Minimum Variance Analysis and the Walen test to analyze possible reconnection exhaust at the interface of ICME and HSS. We perform a Graduated Cylindrical Shell reconstruction of the CME to estimate the geometry and source location of the CME. Finally, we use a two-step Drag Based Model (DBM) model to estimate the region in IP space where the interaction took place. The magnetic obstacle (MO) observed in situ shows a fairly symmetric and undisturbed structure and shows the magnetic flux, helicity, and expansion profile/speed of a typical ICME. The MVA together with the Walen test, however, confirms reconnection exhaust at the ICME HSS boundary. Thus, in situ signatures are in favor of a scenario where the interaction is fairly recent. The trailing HSS shows a distinct velocity profile which first reaches a semi-saturated plateau with an average velocity of 500 km/s and then saturates at a maximum speed of 710 km/s . We find that the HSS interaction with the ICME is influenced only by this initial plateau. The results of the two-step DBM suggest that the ICME has started interacting with the HSS close to Earth (approx 0.81 au), which compares well with the deductions from in situ signatures.

### Magnetized winds of M-type stars and star-planet magnetic interactions... uncertainties and modeling strategy
**Victor Reville,Jamie M. Jasinski,Marco Velli,Antoine Strugarek,Allan Sacha Brun,Neil Murphy,...**


#plasma
### Abstract:
M-type stars are the most common stars in the universe. They are ideal hosts for the search of exoplanets in the habitable zone (HZ), as their small size and low temperature make the HZ much closer in than their solar twins. Harboring very deep convective layers, they also usually exhibit very intense magnetic fields. Understanding their environment, in particular their coronal and wind properties, is thus very important, as they might be very different from what is observed in the solar system. The mass loss rate of M-type stars is poorly known observationally, and recent attempts to estimate it for some of them (TRAPPIST-1, Proxima Cen) can vary by an order of magnitude. In this work, we revisit the stellar wind properties of M-dwarfs in the light of the latest estimates of $\dot{M}$ through Lyman- $\alpha$ absorption at the astropause and slingshot prominences. We outline a modeling strategy to estimate the mass loss rate, radiative loss and wind speed, with uncertainties, based on an Alfv\en wave driven stellar wind model. We find that it is very likely that several TRAPPIST-1 planets lie within the Alfv\en surface, which imply that these planets experience star-planet magnetic interactions (SPMI). We also find that SPMI between Proxima Cen b and its host star could be the reason of recently observed radio emissions.

### Abstract:
Perturbative guiding center theory adequately describes the slow drift motion of charged particles in the strongly-magnetized regime characteristic of thermal particle populations in various magnetic fusion devices. However, it breaks down for particles with large enough energy. We report on a data-driven method for learning a non-perturbative guiding center model from full-orbit particle simulation data. We show the data-driven model significantly outperforms traditional asymptotic theory in magnetization regimes appropriate for fusion-born $\alpha$ -particles in stellarators, thus opening the door to non-perturbative guiding center calculations.

### Ion-Acoustic Wave Dynamics in a Two-Fluid Plasma
**Emily Kelting,J. Douglas Wright**


#plasma
### Abstract:
Plasma is a medium containing free electrons and cations, where each particle group behaves as a conducting fluid with a single velocity and temperature in the presence of electromagnetic fields. The difference in roles electrons and ions play define the two-fluid description of plasma. This paper examines ion-acoustic waves generated by the particles in both hot and cold plasma using a collisionless `Euler-Poisson` (EP) system. Employing phase-space asymptotic analysis, we establish that for specific wave speeds, EP acquires homoclinic orbits at the steady-state equilibrium and consequently, traveling waves. Combining python and Wolfram Mathematica, we captured visualizations of such behavior in one spatial dimension.

### Gyrokinetic Electromagnetic Particle Simulations in Triangular Meshes with C1 Finite Elements
**Zhixin Lu,Guo Meng,Roman Hatzky,Eric Sonnendrucker,Alexey Mishchenko,Jin Chen,...**


#plasma
### Abstract:
The triangular mesh-based gyrokinetic scheme enables comprehensive axis-to-edge studies across the entire plasma volume. Our approach employs triangular finite elements with first-derivative continuity (C1), building on previous work to facilitate gyrokinetic simulations. Additionally, we have adopted the mixed variable/pullback scheme for gyrokinetic electromagnetic particle simulations. The filter-free treatment in the poloidal cross-section with triangular meshes introduces unique features and challenges compared to previous treatments using structured meshes. Our implementation has been validated through benchmarks using ITPA-TAE (Toroidicity-induced Alfv\en Eigenmode) parameters, showing its capability in moderate to small electron skin depth regimes. Additional examinations using experimental parameters confirm its applicability to realistic plasma conditions.

### Omnigenous stellarator equilibria with enhanced stability
**Rahul Gaur,Rory Conlin,David Dickinson,Jason F. Parisi,Daniel Dudt,Dario Panici,...**


#plasma
### Abstract:
To build an economically viable stellarator, it is essential to find a configuration that satisfies a set of favorable properties to achieve efficient steady-state nuclear fusion. One such property is omnigenity, which ensures confinement of trapped particles. After creating an omnigenous equilibrium, one must also ensure reduced transport resulting from kinetic and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instabilities. This study introduces and leverages the GPU-accelerated DESC optimization suite, which is used to design stable high- $\beta$ omnigenous equilibria, achieving Mercier, ideal ballooning, and enhanced kinetic ballooning stability. We explain the link between ideal and kinetic ballooning modes and discover stellarators with second stability, a regime of large pressure gradient where an equilibria becomes ideal ballooning stable.

The prominence rotation resulted from angular momentum conservation within a flux rope where asymmetric heating imposed a net rotation prior to the thermal-instability driven condensation phase. The spectra were created using a library built on the Lightweaver framework called Promweaver, which provides boundary conditions for incorporating the limb-darkened irradiation of the solar disk on isolated structures such as prominences. Our spectra show distinctive rotational signatures for the Mg II k, Ly $\alpha$ , and Ly $\beta$ lines, even in the presence of complex, turbulent solar atmospheric conditions. However, these signals are hardly detectable for the Ca II 8542 \r{A}, H $\alpha$ , Ca II K spectral lines. Most notably we find only a very faint rotational signal in the H $\alpha$ line, thus reigniting the discussion on the existence of sustained rotation in prominences.

### AI Justification:
The paper explores the "spectral characteristics" of solar prominences through a "2.5D magnetohydrodynamical simulation," which aligns with my focus on the "theoretical models" and "multiscale dynamics of magnetic fields in plasma environments." Additionally, the discussion of "asymmetric heating" and "turbulent solar atmospheric conditions" may provide insights into the "force interactions" shaping magnetic dynamics in astrophysical plasmas.

### Quantum kinetic theory of photons in degenerate plasmas... a field-theoretical approach
**J. L. Figueiredo,J. T. Mendonca,H. Tercas**


#plasma
### Abstract:
A rigorous treatment of light-matter interactions typically requires an interacting quantum field theory. However, many practical results are often derived using classical or semiclassical approximations, which are valid only when quantum-field fluctuations can be neglected. This approximation breaks down in scenarios involving large light intensities or degenerate matter, where additional quantum effects become significant. In this work, we address these limitations by developing a quantum kinetic framework that treats both light and matter fields on equal footing, naturally incorporating both linear and nonlinear interactions. To accurately account for light fluctuations, we introduce a photon distribution function that, together with the classical electromagnetic fields, provides a better description of the photon fluid. From this formalism, we derive kinetic equations from first principles that recover classical electrodynamical results while revealing novel couplings absent in classical theory. Furthermore, by addressing the Coulomb interaction in the Hartree-Fock approximation, we include the role of fermionic exchange exactly in both the kinetic and fluid regimes through a generalized Fock potential. The latter provides corrections not only to the electrostatic forces but also to the plasma velocity field, which are important in degenerate conditions.

### AI Justification:
The paper's focus on "light-matter interactions" and the "quantum kinetic framework" addresses the interplay of electromagnetic fields within plasma contexts, which could be relevant to my interest in "magnetic field amplification" and "force interactions." Additionally, the examination of "kinetic equations" and "Coulomb interaction" can offer new perspectives on how magnetic fields evolve under varying conditions, contributing to a deeper understanding of magnetic dynamics in plasma environments.

### Characterising the stellar differential rotation based on largest-spot statistics from ground-based photometry
**Mikko Tuomi,Jyri J. Lehtinen,Gregory W. Henry,Thomas Hackman**


#plasma
### Abstract:
Stellar spot distribution has consequences on the observable periodic signals in long-time baseline ground-based photometry. We model the statistics of the dominating spots of two young and active Solar-type stars, V889 Her and LQ Hya, in order to obtain information on the underlying spot distribution, rotation of the star, as well as the orientation of the stellar axis of spin. By calculating estimates for spot-induced periodicities in independent subsets of photometric data, we obtain statistics based on the dominating spots in each subset, giving rise to largest-spot statistics accounting for stellar geometry and rotation, including differential rotation. Our simple statistical models are able to reproduce the observed distribution of photometric signals rather well. This also enables us to estimate the dependence of angular velocity of the spots as a function of latitude. Our results indicate that V889 Her has a non-monotonic differential rotation curve with a maximum angular velocity between latitudes of 37-40 deg and lower angular velocity at the pole than the equator. Our results for LQ Hya indicate that the star rotates much like a rigid body. Furthermore, the results imply that the monotonic Solar differential rotation curve may not be a universal model for other solar-type stars. The non-monotonicity of the differential rotation of V889 Her is commonly produced in magnetohydrodynamic simulations, which indicates that our results are realistic from a theoretical perspective.


![[mdfiles/2410.06076.md|2410.06076]]
### AI Justification:
While the paper primarily focuses on stellar differential rotation and the statistical modeling of stellar spot distributions, it does touch on relevant concepts such as "magnetohydrodynamic simulations" and the non-monotonic behavior of rotation that may relate to your interests in "magnetic dynamics" and "force interactions shaping magnetic dynamics." However, it lacks a direct focus on plasmas in the interstellar medium or the amplification of magnetic fields, which are core aspects of your research.

### Massive Star Cluster Formation with Binaries. I. Evolution of Binary Populations
**Claude Cournoyer-Cloutier,Alison Sills,William E. Harris,Brooke Polak,Steven Rieder,Eric P. Andersson,...**


#plasma
### Abstract:
We study the evolution of populations of binary stars within massive cluster-forming regions. We simulate the formation of young massive star clusters within giant molecular clouds with masses ranging from 2 x 10 $^{4}$ to 3.2 x 10 $^{5}$ M $_{\odot}$ . We use Torch, which couples stellar dynamics, magnetohydrodynamics, star and binary formation, stellar evolution, and stellar feedback through the AMUSE framework. We find that the binary fraction decreases during cluster formation at all molecular cloud masses. The binaries orbital properties also change, with stronger and quicker changes in denser, more massive clouds. Most of the changes we see can be attributed to the disruption of binaries wider than 100 au, although the close binary fraction also decreases in the densest cluster-forming region. The binary fraction for O stars remains above 90%, but exchanges and dynamical hardening are ubiquitous, indicating that O stars undergo frequent few-body interactions early during the cluster formation process. Changes to the populations of binaries are a by-product of hierarchical cluster assembly... most changes to the binary population take place when the star formation rate is high and there are frequent mergers between sub-clusters in the cluster-forming region. A universal primordial binary distribution based on observed inner companions in the Galactic field is consistent with the binary populations of young clusters with resolved stellar populations, and the scatter between clusters of similar masses could be explained by differences in their formation history.

The paper explores the dynamics of binary populations within massive cluster-forming regions in molecular clouds, which is relevant to your interest in the magnetic dynamics of plasmas in the interstellar medium. Specifically, the use of magnetohydrodynamics to couple stellar dynamics and the influence of gravitational forces during cluster formation may provide insights into how these interactions shape magnetic field behaviors across different scales, particularly in relation to your focus on "Force Interactions Shaping Magnetic Dynamics."

### On the existence of traveling wave solutions for cold plasmas
**Diego Alonso-Oran,Angel Duran,Rafael Granero-Belinchon**


#plasma
### Abstract:
The present paper is concerned with the existence of traveling wave solutions of the asymptotic model, derived by the authors in a previous work, to approximate the unidirectional evolution of a collision-free plasma in a magnetic field. First, using bifurcation theory, we can rigorously prove the existence of periodic traveling waves of small amplitude. Furthermore, our analysis also evidences the existence of different type of traveling waves. To this end, we present a second approach based on the analysis of the differential system satisfied by the traveling-wave profiles, the existence of equilibria, and the identification of associated homo-clinic and periodic orbits around them. The study makes use of linearization techniques and numerical computations to show the existence of different types of traveling-wave solutions, with monotone and non-monotone behaviour and different regularity, as well as periodic traveling waves.

### AI Justification:
This paper addresses the existence of traveling wave solutions in cold plasmas and utilizes bifurcation theory and numerical methods, which can be relevant to understanding the **"interactions between magnetic, gravitational, and thermal forces"** in astrophysical contexts. While it focuses on wave phenomena, the findings on **"different types of traveling waves"** may provide insights that could inform the broader dynamics of **magnetic fields** within turbulent plasma environments in the interstellar medium.

### Auriga Streams I... disrupting satellites surrounding Milky Way-mass haloes at multiple resolutions
**Alexander H. Riley,Nora Shipp,Christine M. Simpson,Rebekka Bieri,Azadeh Fattahi,Shaun T. Brown,...**


#plasma
### Abstract:
In a hierarchically formed Universe, galaxies accrete smaller systems that tidally disrupt as they evolve in the hosts potential. We present a complete catalogue of disrupting galaxies accreted onto Milky Way-mass haloes from the Auriga suite of cosmological magnetohydrodynamic zoom-in simulations. We classify accretion events as intact satellites, stellar streams, or phase-mixed systems based on automated criteria calibrated to a visually classified sample, and match accretions to their counterparts in haloes re-simulated at higher resolution. Most satellites with a bound progenitor at the present day have lost substantial amounts of stellar mass -- 67 per cent have $f_\text{bound} < 0.97$ (our threshold to no longer be considered intact), while 53 per cent satisfy a more stringent $f_\text{bound} < 0.8$ . Streams typically outnumber intact systems, contribute a smaller fraction of overall accreted stars, and are substantial contributors at intermediate distances from the host centre ( $\sim$ 0.1 to $\sim$ 0.7 $R_\text{200m}$ , or $\sim$ 35 to $\sim$ 250 kpc for the Milky Way). We also identify accretion events that disrupt to form streams around massive intact satellites instead of the main host. Streams are more likely than intact or phase-mixed systems to have experienced preprocessing, suggesting this mechanism is important for setting disruption rates around Milky Way-mass haloes. All of these results are preserved across different simulation resolutions, though we do find some hints that satellites disrupt more readily at lower resolution. The Auriga haloes suggest that disrupting satellites surrounding Milky Way-mass galaxies are the norm and that a wealth of tidal features waits to be uncovered in upcoming surveys.

### AI Justification:
While the paper addresses the dynamics of disrupting satellites around Milky Way-mass haloes through cosmological magnetohydrodynamic simulations, it lacks a direct focus on **magnetic field amplification** and **force interactions shaping magnetic dynamics** within interstellar plasma that align with your theoretical astrophysics interest. However, the mention of “magnetohydrodynamic” processes implies potential relevance to the behavior of magnetic fields in plasma environments, albeit not in the specific cosmic contexts you are exploring.

### A Study on the Nested Rings CME Structure Observed by the WISPR Imager Onboard Parker Solar Probe
**Shaheda Begum Shaik,Mark G. Linton,Sarah E. Gibson,Phillip Hess,Robin C. Colaninno,Guillermo Stenborg,...**


#plasma
### Abstract:
Despite the significance of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) in space weather, a comprehensive understanding of their interior morphology remains a scientific challenge, particularly with the advent of many state-of-the-art solar missions such as Parker Solar Probe (Parker) and Solar Orbiter (SO). In this study, we present an analysis of a complex CME as observed by the Wide-Field Imager for Solar PRobe (WISPR) heliospheric imager during Parkers seventh solar encounter. The CME morphology does not fully conform with the general three-part density structure, exhibiting a front and core not significantly bright, with a highly structured overall configuration. In particular, its morphology reveals non-concentric nested rings, which we argue are a signature of the embedded helical magnetic flux rope (MFR) of the CME. For that, we analyze the morphological and kinematical properties of the nested density structures and demonstrate that they outline the projection of the three-dimensional structure of the flux rope as it crosses the lines of sight of the WISPR imager, thereby revealing the magnetic field geometry. Comparison of observations from various viewpoints suggests that the CME substructures can be discerned owing to the ideal viewing perspective, close proximity, and spatial resolution of the observing instrument.

### Solar Plasma Noise in TianQin Laser Propagation... An Extreme Case and Statistical Analysis
**Liu YaNan,Su Wei,Zhang XueFeng,Zhang JiXiang,Zhou ShenWei**


#plasma
### Abstract:
TianQin proposes to detect gravitational wave signals by using laser interferometry. However, laser propagation effect introduces a potential noise factor for TianQin. In this work, we used MHD simulations to obtain the space magnetic field and plasma distributions during an extremely strong solar eruption, and based on the magnetohydrodynamic simulation result, we investigate laser propagation noise for TianQin. For the extremely strong solar eruption event, we find that the laser propagation noise closely approaches 100\% of TianQins displacement noise requirement for Michelson combination; While the laser propagation noise is still about 30\% of TianQins displacement noise requirement for time-delay interferometry X combination. In addition, we investigate the laser propagation noise for 12 cases with different solar wind conditions. Our finding reveals a linear correlation between the laser propagation noise and several space weather parameters, e.g., solar wind dynamic pressure, Sym-H, and $D$ st, where the correlation coefficients for solar wind dynamic pressure is strongest. Combining the cumulative distribution of solar wind dynamic pressure from 1999 to 2021 with the linear correlation between solar wind dynamic pressure and laser propagation noise, we have determined that the occurrence rate of the laser propagation noise to be greater than 30\% of TianQins displacement noise requirement for Michelson combination over the entire solar activity week is about 15\%. In addition, we find that time-delay interferometry can suppress the laser propagation noise, and reduce the occurrence rate of the laser propagation noise exceeding 30\% of TianQins requirement to less than 1\%.

### AI Justification:
This paper evaluates the impact of magnetic field and plasma distributions during solar eruptions on laser propagation noise for the TianQin project, which might provide insight into how the dynamics of solar plasma affect various astrophysical phenomena. Although the focus is primarily on laser noise rather than magnetic field amplification or the interactions shaping dynamic behaviors in plasma, the utilization of MHD simulations could offer ancillary insights into the behavior of magnetic fields in extreme solar events, potentially relating to your interest in how magnetic fields amplify and interact within astrophysical plasmas.

### Fast Plasma Frequency Sweep in Drude-like EM Scatterers via the Reduced-Basis Method
**Clara Iglesias-Tesouro,Valentin de la Rubia,Alessio Monti,Filiberto Bilotti**


#plasma
### Abstract:
In this work, we propose to use the Reduced-Basis Method (RBM) as a model order reduction approach to solve Maxwells equations in electromagnetic (EM) scatterers based on plasma to build a metasurface, taking into account a parameter, namely, the plasma frequency. We build up the reduced-order model in an adaptive fashion following a greedy algorithm. This method enables a fast sweep over a wide range of plasma frequencies, thus providing an efficient way to characterize electromagnetic structures based on Drude-like plasma scatterers. We validate and test the proposed technique on several plasma metasurfaces and compare it with the finite element method (FEM) approach.

### Simulations of Protostar-Driven Photoionization in Herbig-Haro Jets
**Z. Ahmane,A. Mignone,C. Zanni,S. Massaglia,A. Bouldjderi**


#plasma
### Abstract:
Recent studies showed that observations of line emission from shocks in YSO jets require a substantial amount of ionization of the pre-shock matter. Photoionization from X-ray emitted close to the central source may be responsible for the initial ionization fraction. The aim of our work is to study the effect of X-ray photoionization, coming from the vicinity of the central star, on the ionization fraction inside the jet that can be advected at large distances. For this purpose we have performed axisymmetric MHD jet launching simulations including photoionization and optically thin losses using PLUTO. For typical X-ray luminosities in classical T-Tauri stars, we see that the photoionization is responsible for ionizing to 10 % -20 % the jet close to the star.


![[mdfiles/2410.11692.md|2410.11692]]
### AI Justification:
The paper presents simulations of MHD jet launching and examines the effects of photoionization on ionization fractions, which is relevant to the magnetic dynamics of plasmas, particularly in astrophysical contexts like protostar jets. However, while it incorporates some aspects of how magnetic fields interact within jets, it primarily focuses on ionization rather than direct mechanisms of magnetic field amplification or shaping interactions in the broader interstellar medium, making it only partially aligned with your specific interests.

### Revealing EMRI/IMRI candidates with quasiperiodic ultrafast outflows
**Michal Zajacek,Petra Sukova,Vladimir Karas,Dheeraj R. Pasham,Francesco Tombesi,Petr Kurfurst,...**


#plasma
### Abstract:
The first detection of the quasiperiodic ultrafast outflow in the ASASSN-20qc system was reported by Pasham et al. (2024). The outflow is revealed in the soft X-ray spectra as an absorption feature, which is periodically enhanced every $ \sim 8.3$ days. The periodic nature of the ultrafast outflow is best explained by an orbiting massive perturber, most likely an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH), that is inclined with respect to the accretion flow around the primary supermassive black hole (SMBH). In this way, the orbiting body pushes the disc gas into the outflow funnel, where it is accelerated by the ordered magnetic field (Sukov\a et al. 2021). Quasiperiodic ultrafast outflows (QPOuts) are thus a novel phenomenon that can help reveal new extreme-/intemediate-mass ratio inspiral (EMRI/IMRI) candidates that otherwise do not exhibit significant periodic patterns in the continuum flux density.


![[mdfiles/2410.12090.md|2410.12090]]
### AI Justification:
This paper primarily discusses the interaction between an orbiting massive perturber and magnetic fields within an accretion flow, which relates to my research focus on the "interactions between magnetic, gravitational, and thermal forces." However, while it references "accelerated by the ordered magnetic field," it lacks a deeper exploration of magnetic dynamics or amplification mechanisms relevant to plasma in the interstellar medium.

### Nonlinear bayesian tomography of ion temperature and velocity for Doppler coherence imaging spectroscopy in RT-1
**Kenji Ueda,Masaki. Nishiura**


#plasma
### Abstract:
We present a novel Bayesian tomography approach for Coherence Imaging Spectroscopy (CIS) that simultaneously reconstructs ion temperature and velocity distributions in plasmas. Utilizing nonlinear Gaussian Process Tomography (GPT) with the Laplace approximation, we model prior distributions of log-emissivity, temperature, and velocity as Gaussian processes. This framework rigorously incorporates nonlinear effects and temperature dependencies often neglected in conventional CIS tomography, enabling robust reconstruction even in the region of high temperature and velocity. By applying a log-Gaussian process, we also address issues like velocity divergence in low-emissivity regions. Validated with phantom simulations and experimental data from the RT-1 device, our method reveals detailed spatial structures of ion temperature and toroidal ion flow characteristic of magnetospheric plasma. This work significantly broadens the scope of CIS tomography, offering a robust tool for plasma diagnostics and facilitating integration with complementary measurement techniques.

### Impact of Ion Mobility on Electron Density and Temperature in Hypersonic Flows
**Felipe Martin Rodriguez Fuentes,Bernard Parent**


#plasma
### Abstract:
This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of how ion mobility affects electron density and temperature in hypersonic flows. We compare two ion mobility models... one derived from Gupta-Yos cross-sections, and the other from swarm drift velocity experiments. The ion mobility model significantly alters the plasma density around a hypersonic waverider, with increases of more than twofold observed at low dynamic pressures and high Mach numbers. This is partly due to electron loss through surface catalysis, which depends on ambipolar diffusion scaling with ion mobility. We also derive novel scaling laws that highlight the strong dependence of electron cooling on ion mobility both within the quasi-neutral regions and the non-neutral plasma sheaths. Electron cooling influences the electron temperature across the plasma, leading to a previously unrecognized impact of ion mobility on plasma bulk temperature. This in turn affects plasma density via electron-ion recombination rates which are temperature-dependent. Accurately modeling ion mobility is critical for predicting hypersonic plasma behavior, with important implications for optimizing magnetohydrodynamic technologies and mitigating or exploiting plasma-induced interference with electromagnetic waves.

### AI Justification:
While the paper's focus on ion mobility in hypersonic flows may not directly address the magnetic dynamics of plasmas in the interstellar medium, it touches on relevant themes such as "plasma density" and "plasma behavior," which could inform our understanding of magnetic field interactions within densely packed plasma environments. Additionally, the emphasis on modeling ion mobility to predict plasma behavior aligns with your interest in theoretical models and simulations of complex magnetic dynamics, suggesting potential insights on force interactions shaping magnetic fields.

### Using the Ca II lines in T Tauri stars to infer the abundance of refractory elements in the innermost disk regions
**Marbely Micolta,Nuria Calvet,Thanawuth Thanathibodee,Gladis Magris C.,Carlo F. Manara,Laura Venuti,...**


#plasma
### Abstract:
We present a study of the abundance of calcium in the innermost disk of 70 T Tauri stars in the star-forming regions of Chamaeleon I, Lupus and Orion OB1b. We use calcium as a proxy for the refractory material that reaches the inner disk. We used magnetospheric accretion models to analyze the Ca II emission lines and estimate abundances in the accretion flows of the stars, which feed from the inner disks. We find Ca depletion in disks of all three star-forming regions, with 57% of the sample having [Ca/H] < -0.30 relative to the solar abundance. All disks with cavities and/or substructures show depletion, consistent with trapping of refractories in pressure bumps. Significant Ca depletion ([Ca/H] < -0.30) is also measured in 60% of full disks, although some of those disks may have hidden substructures or cavities. We find no correlation between Ca abundance and stellar or disk parameters except for the mass accretion rate onto the star. This could suggest that the inner and outer disks are decoupled, and that the mass accretion rate is related to a mass reservoir in the inner disk, while refractory depletion reflects phenomena in the outer disk related to the presence of structure and forming planets. Our results of refractory depletion and timescales for depletion are qualitatively consistent with expectations of dust growth and radial drift including partitioning of elements and constitute direct evidence that radial drift of solids locked in pebbles takes place in disks.

### Prediction of Large Solar Flares Based on SHARP and HED Magnetic Field Parameters
**Xuebao Li,Xuefeng Li,Yanfang Zheng,Ting Li,Pengchao Yan,Hongwei Ye,...**


#plasma
### Abstract:
The existing flare prediction primarily relies on photospheric magnetic field parameters from the entire active region (AR), such as Space-Weather HMI Activity Region Patches (SHARP) parameters. However, these parameters may not capture the details the AR evolution preceding flares. The magnetic structure within the core area of an AR is essential for predicting large solar flares. This paper utilizes the area of high photospheric free energy density (HED region) as a proxy for the AR core region. We construct two datasets... SHARP and HED datasets. The ARs contained in both datasets are identical. Furthermore, the start and end times for the same AR in both datasets are identical. We develop six models for 24-hour solar flare forecasting, utilizing SHARP and HED datasets. We then compare their categorical and probabilistic forecasting performance. Additionally, we conduct an analysis of parameter importance. The main results are as follows... (1) Among the six solar flare prediction models, the models using HED parameters outperform those using SHARP parameters in both categorical and probabilistic prediction, indicating the important role of the HED region in the flare initiation process. (2) The Transformer flare prediction model stands out significantly in True Skill Statistic (TSS) and Brier Skill Score (BSS), surpassing the other models. (3) In parameter importance analysis, the total photospheric free magnetic energy density ( $\mathrm {E_{free}}$ ) within the HED parameters excels in both categorical and probabilistic forecasting. Similarly, among the SHARP parameters, the R_VALUE stands out as the most effective parameter for both categorical and probabilistic forecasting.

### AI Justification:
The paper's focus on "photospheric magnetic field parameters" and the "magnetic structure within the core area of an AR" aligns with your interest in "magnetic field amplification" and how various mechanisms influence "the behavior of magnetic fields within plasma environments." Additionally, the discussion of the "total photospheric free magnetic energy density" likely relates to the scale-dependent dynamics of magnetic fields, which is a key aspect of your research.

### NuSTAR view of the accreting X-ray pulsars IGR J17480-2446 and IGR J17511-3057

#plasma
### Abstract:
We report on the NuSTAR observations of the accreting pulsars IGR~J17480-2446 and IGR~J17511-3057 performed on March 4, 2023, and April 8, 2015, respectively. We describe the continuum emission of IGR~J17480-2446 with a combination of two soft thermal components and an additional hard X-ray emission described by a power-law. We suggest that the spectral properties of IGR~J17480-2446 are consistent with a soft state, different from many other accreting X-ray millisecond pulsars usually found in the hard spectral state. The source IGR~J17511-3057 exhibits a hard spectrum characterized by a Comptonized emission from the corona. The X-ray spectrum of both sources shows evidence of disc reflection. For the first time, we employ the self-consistent reflection models ({\tt relxill} and {\tt relxillNS}) to fit the reflection features in the NuSTAR spectrum. From the best-fit spectral model, we find an inner disc radius is precisely constrained to $(1.99-2.68)\...R_{ISCO}$ and inclination to $30\pm 1$ degree for IGR~J17480-2446. We determine an inner disc radius of $\lesssim 1.3\;R_{ISCO}$ and inclination of $44\pm 3$ degree for IGR~J17511-3057. A low inclination angle of the system is required for both sources. We further place an upper limit on the magnetic field strength of the sources, considering the disc is truncated at the magnetospheric radius.

### AI Justification:
The paper presents observations of X-ray pulsars and includes an examination of the magnetic properties at play, remarking on the "upper limit on the magnetic field strength" which aligns with my interest in "how magnetic fields behave, interact, and amplify across various scales." However, while it discusses magnetic field implications, it primarily focuses on observational data rather than theoretical models or complex dynamics in plasma environments, offering limited insight into the detailed magnetic dynamics of interstellar plasma that I aim to explore.

### Incidence of afterglow plateaus in GRBs associated with binary neutron star mergers
**Luca Guglielmi,Giulia Stratta,Simone Dall'Osso,Paramvir Singh,Marcella Brusa,Rosalba Perna**


#plasma
### Abstract:
One of the most surprising Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) features discovered with the Swift-X ray telescope (XRT) is a plateau phase in the early X-ray afterglow lightcurves. These plateaus are observed in the majority of long GRBs, while their incidence in short GRBs is still uncertain due to their fainter X-ray afterglow luminosity with respect to long GRBs. An accurate estimate of the fraction of short GRBs with plateaus is of utmost relevance given the implications on the jet structure and possibly on the nature of the binary neutron star (BNS) merger remnant. This work presents the results of an extensive data analysis of the largest and most up-to-date sample of short GRBs observed with the XRT, and for which the redshift has been measured. We found a plateau incidence of 18-37% in short GRBs, a fraction significantly lower than the one measured in long GRBs (>50%). Although still debated, the plateau phase could be explained as energy injection from the spin-down power of a newly born magnetized neutron star (magnetar). We show that this scenario can nicely reproduce the observed short GRB plateaus, while at the same time providing a natural explanation for the different plateau fractions between short and long GRBs. In particular, our findings may imply that only a minority of BNS mergers generating short GRBs leave behind a stable neutron star (NS) or a long-lived NS, long enough to form a plateau, constraining the maximum NS mass to be in the range $\sim$ 2.3 - 2.35 M $_{\odot}$ .

Although it does not directly address the broader topics of magnetic field amplification or interactions in the interstellar medium, it could provide insights into the role of magnetars, which may have implications for understanding "emergent magnetic dynamics in turbulent plasmas."

### Stripping of a neutron star in a close binary system in a pair with a black hole
**Nikita Kramarev,Alexander Kuranov,Andrey Yudin,Konstantin Postnov**


#plasma
### Abstract:
We consider the final evolutionary stages of a neutron star-black hole pair. According to the current paradigm, such systems eventually coalesce, which in some cases is accompanied by neutron-star tidal disruption. Using analytical methods, we show that the scenario of slow (of the order of several seconds) neutron-star stripping by the black hole is also possible, depending on the system parameters (the initial masses and intrinsic angular momenta of the components, the equation of state for the neutron star). Reaching the lower mass limit (about one tenth of the solar mass), the neutron star explodes to produce a comparatively powerful electromagnetic transient. Our population calculations show that the stripping mechanism is possible in 50-90% of the cases among all coalescing neutron star-black hole pairs, depending on the model assumptions about the evolution of close binary systems (the common-envelope efficiency parameter, the supernova explosion mechanism) and the initial metallicity of the stellar population. Because of the large mass of the ejected material, the kilonova emission in this scenario has good prospects of detection.

### Three-dimensional simulation of film boiling on a horizontal surface with magnetic field
**Hao-Tao Gu,Kirti Chandra Sahu,Jie Zhang,Ming-Jiu Ni**


#plasma
### Abstract:
This study conducts a numerical investigation into the three-dimensional film boiling of liquid under the influence of external magnetic fields. The numerical method incorporates a sharp phase-change model based on the volume-of-fluid approach to track the liquid-vapor interface. Additionally, a consistent and conservative scheme is employed to calculate the induced current densities and electromagnetic forces. We investigate the magnetohydrodynamic effects on film boiling, particularly examining the pattern transition of the vapor bubble and the evolution of heat transfer characteristics, exposed to either a vertical or horizontal magnetic field. In single-mode scenarios, film boiling under a vertical magnetic field displays an isotropic flow structure, forming a columnar vapor jet at higher magnetic field intensities. In contrast, horizontal magnetic fields result in anisotropic flow, creating a two-dimensional vapor sheet as the magnetic strength increases. In multi-mode scenarios, the patterns observed in single-mode film boiling persist, with the interaction of vapor bubbles introducing additional complexity to the magnetohydrodynamic flow. More importantly, our comprehensive analysis reveals how and why distinct boiling effects are generated by various orientations of magnetic fields, which induce directional electromagnetic forces to suppress flow vortices within the cross-sectional plane.

### Magnetic mesh generation and field line reconstruction for scrape-off layer and divertor modeling in stellarators
**H. Frerichs,D. Boeyaert,Y. Feng,K. A. Garcia**


#plasma
### Abstract:
The design of divertor targets and baffles for optimal heat and particle exhaust from magnetically confined fusion plasmas requires a combination of fast, low-fidelity models (such as EMC3-lite [1]) for scoping studies and high-fidelity ones (such as EMC3-EIRENE [2]) for verification. Both of those approaches benefit from a magnetic flux tube mesh for fast interpolation and mapping of field line segments [3]. A new mesh generator for unstructured quadrilateral flux tubes with adaptive refinement is presented and integrated into FLARE [4]. For HSX with an extended first wall, it is found that several layers of flux tubes can span the entire half field period before splitting is required. This is an advantage over the traditional setup of the EMC3-EIRENE mesh where careful construction of several sub-domains is required already for the much tighter present first wall. The divide and conquer paradigm with unstructured mesh layout offers a powerful alternative for integration into optimization workflows. Further examples for W7-X and CTH are presented.

### AI Justification:
The paper discusses "magnetic flux tube mesh" for modeling in stellarators, which is somewhat related to the interactions of "magnetic, gravitational, and thermal forces" in plasma. However, it primarily focuses on fusion plasmas and mesh generation techniques rather than the magnetic dynamics in the interstellar medium, which is a core interest of my research in theoretical astrophysics.

### Time Variation of the Solar Tachocline
**Sarbani Basu,Wesley Antonio Machado Andrade de Aguiar,Sylvain G. Korzennik**


#plasma
### Abstract:
We have used solar oscillation frequencies and frequency splittings obtained over solar cycles 23, 24 and the rising phase of solar cycle 25 to investigate whether the tachocline properties (jump i.e., the change in the rotation rate across the tachocline, width and position) show any time variation. We confirm that the change in rotation rate across the tachocline changes substantially, however, the change does not show a simple correlation with solar cycle unlike, for instance, changes in mode frequencies. The change during the ascending phase of solar cycle 25 is almost a mirror image of the change during the descending part of solar cycle 24, tempting us to speculate that the tachocline has a much longer period than either the sunspot or the magnetic cycle. We also find that the position of the tachocline, defined as the mid-point of the change in rotation rate, showed significant changes during solar cycle 24. The width of the tachocline, on the other hand, has showed significant changes during solar cycle 23, but not later. The change in the tachocline becomes more visible if we look at the upper and lower extents of the tachocline, defined as (position +/- width). We find that for epochs around solar maxima and minima, the extent decreases before increasing again - a few more years of data should clarify this trend. Our results reinforce the need to continue helioseismic monitoring of the Sun to understand solar activity and its evolution.

### AI Justification:
While the paper discusses variations in the solar tachocline and its relationship with solar cycles, it does not directly address the fundamental aspects of magnetic field amplification or the interactions of magnetic forces within plasma, which are central to your research on "magnetic dynamics of plasmas in the interstellar medium." Although it touches on changes related to the tachocline and rotational dynamics, this focus on local solar phenomena limits its relevance to your interests in broader plasma environments across various astrophysical scales.

### A solar rotation signature in cosmic dust... frequency analysis of dust particle impacts on the Wind spacecraft
**Lennart R. Baalmann,Silvan Hunziker,Arthur Peronne,James W. Kirchner,Karl-Heinz Glassmeier,David M. Malaspina,...**


#plasma
### Abstract:
Dust particle impacts on the Wind spacecraft were detected with its plasma wave instrument Wind/WAVES. Frequency analysis on this dust impact time series revealed spectral peaks indicative of a solar rotation signature. We investigated whether this solar rotation signature is embedded in the interplanetary or interstellar dust (ISD) and whether it is caused by co-rotating interaction regions (CIRs), by the sector structure of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), or by external effects. We performed frequency analysis on subsets of the data to investigate the origin of these spectral peaks, comparing segments of Winds orbit when the spacecraft moved against or with the ISD inflow direction and comparing the time periods of the ISD focusing and defocusing phases of the solar magnetic cycle. A superposed epoch analysis of the number of dust impacts during CIRs was used to investigate the systematic effect of CIRs. Case studies of time periods with frequent or infrequent occurrences of CIRs were compared to synthetic data of dust impacts affected by CIRs. We performed similar case studies for time periods with a stable or chaotic IMF sector structure. The superposed epoch analysis was repeated for a time series of the spacecraft floating potential. Spectral peaks were found at the solar rotation period of ~27d and its harmonics at 13.5d and 9d. This solar rotation signature may affect both interplanetary and ISD. The appearance of this signature correlates with the occurrence of CIRs but not with the stability of the IMF sector structure. The CIRs cause, on average, a reduction in the number of dust impact detections. Periodic changes of the spacecrafts floating potential were found to partially counteract this reduction by enhancing the instruments sensitivity to dust impacts; these changes of the floating potential are thus unlikely to be the cause of the solar rotation signature.


![[mdfiles/2410.02351.md|2410.02351]]
### AI Justification:
The paper explores the interaction between cosmic dust impacts and solar phenomena, revealing a solar rotation signature that may influence the interplanetary and interstellar environments, which could be tangentially related to the dynamics of magnetic fields in plasma environments, particularly in analyzing how forces like those in co-rotating interaction regions (CIRs) affect these dynamics. However, it lacks a direct focus on fundamental magnetic field amplification mechanisms, emergent behaviors within turbulent plasmas, or a detailed theoretical model relevant to structure shaping on scales critical to my research focus.

### Kerr black hole energy extraction, irreducible mass feedback, and the effect of captured particles charge
**J. A. Rueda,R. Ruffini**


#plasma
### Abstract:
We analyze the extraction of the rotational energy of a Kerr black hole (BH) endowed with a test charge and surrounded by an external test magnetic field and ionized low-density matter. For a magnetic field parallel to the BH spin, electrons move outward (inward) and protons inward (outward) in a region around the BH poles (equator). For zero charge, the polar region comprises spherical polar angles $-60^\circ\lesssim \theta \lesssim 60^\circ$ and the equatorial region $60^\circ\lesssim \theta \lesssim 120^\circ$ . The polar region shrinks for positive charge, and the equatorial region enlarges. For an isotropic particle density, we argue the BH could experience a cyclic behavior... starting from a zero charge, it accretes more polar protons than equatorial electrons, gaining net positive charge, energy, and angular momentum. Then, the shrinking(enlarging) of the polar(equatorial) region makes it accrete more equatorial electrons than polar protons, gaining net negative charge, energy, and angular momentum. In this phase, the BH rotational energy is extracted. The extraction process continues until the new enlargement of the polar region reverses the situation, and the cycle repeats. We show that this electrodynamical process produces a relatively limited increase of the BH irreducible mass compared to gravitational mechanisms like the Penrose process, hence being a more efficient and promising mechanism for extracting the BH rotational energy.


![[mdfiles/2410.04776.md|2410.04776]]
### AI Justification:
While the paper primarily focuses on energy extraction from Kerr black holes and the dynamics of charged particles around them, the mention of "external test magnetic field" hints at interactions between magnetic fields and charged particles, which can align with your interest in "magnetic field amplification." However, the abstract does not delve into the broader aspects of magnetic dynamics or plasma behavior in interstellar environments, significantly reducing its relevance to your specific areas of focus.

### Changing-Look Inspirals... Trends and Switches in AGN Disk Emission as Signposts for Merging Black Hole Binaries
**Jonathan Zrake,Madeline Clyburn,Samuel Feyan**


#plasma
### Abstract:
Using grid-based hydrodynamics simulations and analytic modeling, we compute the electromagnetic (EM) signatures of gravitational wave (GW) driven inspirals of massive black hole binaries that accrete gas from circumbinary disks, exploring the effects of varying gas temperatures, viscosity laws, and binary mass ratios. Our main finding is that active galactic nuclei (AGNs) that host inspiraling binaries can exhibit two sub-types of long-term secular variability patterns... Type-A events which dim before merger and brighten afterward, and Type-B events which brighten before merger and dim afterward. In both types the merger coincides with a long-lasting chromatic change of the AGN appearance. The sub-types correspond to the direction of angular momentum transfer between the binary and the disk, and could thus have correlated GW signatures if the gas-induced torque can be inferred from GW phase drift measurements by LISA. The long-term brightness trends are caused by steady weakening of the disk-binary torque that accompanies orbital decay, it induces a hysteresis effect whereby the disk `remembers` the history of the binarys contraction. We illustrate the effect using a reduced model problem of an axisymmetric thin disk subjected at its inner edge to the weakening torque of an inspiraling binary. The model problem yields a new class of self-similar disk solutions, which capture salient features of the multi-dimensional hydrodynamics simulations. We use these solutions to derive variable AGN disk emission signatures within years to decades of massive black hole binary mergers in AGNs. Spectral changes of Mrk 1018 might have been triggered by an inspiral-merger event.

This paper explores electromagnetic signatures and dynamic interactions within active galactic nuclei (AGNs) related to the merger of black hole binaries, which does engage indirectly with force interactions shaping magnetic dynamics. However, it primarily focuses on gravitational waves and gas dynamics rather than the specific magnetic field amplification or emergent dynamics you are interested in, thus offering only tangential relevance to your theoretical astrophysics and plasma physics research.

### Trapping of electromagnetic waves by two dimensional plasma-metamaterial composite structures
**D. Tsiklauri,I. Morrison**


#plasma
### Abstract:
In this work we (i) extend previous 1D studies of electromagnetic (EM) wave propagation in an over-dense plasma-metamaterial composite into two spatial dimensions and (ii) study trapping of EM waves by the composite 2D structures (barriers). Such barriers are formed when metamaterial spatially co-exists with a plasma density depletion in a form of a slab or two-dimensional density rectangular depletions (DRDs). This is analogous to EM wave trapping by preformed density cavities in near-critical density plasmas, studied before. We find that plasma-metamaterial composite allows to trap EM waves by both slab and DRD configurations, thus forming a standing wave at the edge of an opaque region. The standing wave subsequently damps which offers applications such as heat deposition or substrate materials (micro)machining depending on EM wave intensity. The established results may find future applications such as... more efficient plasma vapour deposition, controlling EM wave propagation (EM wave trapping) in invisibility cloaks and alike. The EM wave trapping conditions are elucidated by a set of particle-in-cell (PIC) numerical simulations.

### Superradiance of charged black holes embedded in dark matter halos
**Alessandro Mollicone,Kyriakos Destounis**


#plasma
### Abstract:
Astrophysical environments are ubiquitous in the Universe; from accretion disks around black holes to galactic dark matter halos, distributions of astrophysical material veil the vast majority of Cosmos. Including environmental effects in strong-field gravity and astrophysics is, therefore, a rather tantalizing task in the quest for novel gravitational-wave phenomena. Here, we examine how environments affect the high-energy process of superradiance. In particular, we study the amplification of charged scalar waves under the expense of the electrostatic energy contained in a charged black hole that is embedded in an observationally-motivated, and qualitatively generic, dark matter halo. We find that the superradiant amplification of massless charged scalar fields scattering off environmentally-enriched charged black holes can be equally efficient to those occurring in vacuum charged black holes. This occurs due to the fact that the sole interplay between the scalar wave and the black hole is the electromagnetic interaction. The addition of mass on the charged scalar waves leads to a rapid suppression of superradiant amplification. This transpires to a great extent due to the `friction that the mass introduces to the black hole potential. Nevertheless, for sufficiently large scalar masses, the amplification factors can be also subdominantly affected by the compactness of the halo. This occurs because the gravitational interaction between the dense halo and the waves mass grows, thus further suppressing the superradiant amplification.

### AI Justification:
This paper presents an investigation into the interplay between charged black holes and their surrounding environments, particularly focusing on the amplification of scalar waves due to electromagnetic interactions, which aligns with your interest in "magnetic dynamics of plasmas" and "force interactions shaping magnetic dynamics." However, while it touches on themes of amplification and interaction, it diverges significantly from your primary focus on plasmas and magnetic fields in the interstellar medium, particularly in the context of charge dynamics and plasma turbulence.

### Abstract:
The BL Lac Object PKS 1717+177 has been identified as potential neutrino-emitting AGN in the point source stacking analysis of IceCube data. We explore peculiarities in the morphology and kinematics of the jet and examine multi-wavelength light curves for distinctive effects which might allow to pinpoint a likely neutrino generation mechanism. We re-modeled 34 high resolution radio interferometric Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations obtained at 15 GHz (between 1999/12/27 and 2023/05/03). A correlation and periodicity analysis of optical KAIT and Tuorla data, as well as for Fermi-LAT $\gamma$ -ray data has been performed. The nuclear jet appears deflected and bent at about 0.5 mas distance from the radio core by an encounter with a dark, unseen object. The deviation of the jet evolves over 23.5 years from a simple apparent bend into a significantly meandering structure with increasing amplitude... a zig-zag line. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the temporal evolution of a jet deviation can be traced. The turning point shifts with time and the jet seems to brighten up almost periodically at the point of deviation. The radio core as well as the jet contribute approximately equally to the total flux-density at 15 GHz. We discuss scenarios which could explain the complex jet bending and quasi-regular flaring. We propose that the jet could either be deflected by the magnetosphere of a second massive black hole, by the pressure gradient due to a circumnuclear dense cloud, or via gravitational lensing by an intervening black hole.

### AI Justification:
This paper is only marginally relevant to your research focus. While it discusses the dynamics of jets from an active galactic nucleus (AGN)—a topic that may touch upon magnetic interactions in plasma—the primary emphasis is on the morphology and kinematics of jets rather than on the mechanisms of magnetic field amplification or the interactions of magnetic fields within plasma environments, as highlighted by your interests in "magnetic dynamics" and "scale-dependent magnetic structuring."

### Enhancement to Fusion Reactivity in Sheared Flows
**Henry Fetsch,Nathaniel J. Fisch**


#plasma
### Abstract:
Sheared flow increases the reactivity of fusion plasma. In unmagnetized DT plasma with flow gradients comparable to the mean free path of reacting ions, reactivity can be more than doubled. Neutron spectra are modified, helping to explain anomalous observations. The reactivity enhancement is particularly relevant in inertial confinement fusion (ICF), where it allows turbulent kinetic energy to contribute to the fusion burn even before thermalizing. In high-yield ICF experiments, the effect is most pronounced before bang time, suggesting a new mechanism for fast ignition.


![[mdfiles/2410.03590.md|2410.03590]]
### AI Justification:
Although the paper discusses plasma dynamics in the context of fusion reactivity and sheared flows, it does not specifically address the magnetic field amplification or interactions within plasmas in the interstellar medium that align with my research focus. The mention of "turbulent kinetic energy" does connect to my interest in turbulence, but the primary focus on fusion rather than the astrological context and magnetic dynamics limits its relevance for my work.

### On the Low-Latitude Ionospheric Irregularities under Geomagnetically Active and Quiet Conditions using NavIC observables... A Spectral Analysis Approach
**Sumanjit Chakraborty,Abhirup Datta**


#plasma
### Abstract:
Ionospheric irregularities and associated scintillations under geomagnetically active/quiet conditions have detrimental effects on the reliability and performance of space- and ground-based navigation satellite systems, especially over the low-latitude region. The current work investigates the low-latitude ionospheric irregularities using the phase screen theory and the corresponding temporal Power Spectral Density (PSD) analysis to present an estimate of the outer irregularity scale sizes over these locations. The study uses simultaneous L5 signal C/N $_o$ observations of NavIC (a set of GEO and GSO navigation satellite systems) near the northern crest of EIA (Indore... 22.52 $^\circ$ N, 75.92 $^\circ$ E, dip... 32.23 $^\circ$ N) and in between the crest and the dip equator (Hyderabad... 17.42 $^\circ$ N, 78.55 $^\circ$ E, dip... 21.69 $^\circ$ N). The study period (2017-2018) covers disturbed and quiet-time conditions in the declining phase of the solar cycle 24. The PSD analysis brings forward the presence of irregularities, of the order of a few hundred meters during weak-to-moderate and quiet-time conditions and up to a few km during the strong event, over both locations. The ROTI values validate the presence of such structures in the Indian region. Furthermore, only for the strong event, a time delay of scintillation occurrence over Indore, with values of 36 minutes and 50 minutes for NavIC satellites (PRNs) 5 and 6, respectively, from scintillation occurrence at Hyderabad is observed, suggesting a poleward evolution of irregularity structures. Further observations show a westward propagation of these structures on this day. This study brings forward the advantage of utilizing continuous data from the GEO and GSO satellite systems in understanding the evolution and propagation of the ionospheric irregularities over the low-latitude region.


![[mdfiles/2410.10386.md|2410.10386]]
### AI Justification:
This paper, while focusing primarily on ionospheric irregularities, somewhat aligns with your interest in the "magnetic dynamics of plasmas" through its investigation into the "temporal Power Spectral Density (PSD) analysis" of irregularities in the low-latitude ionosphere, as these dynamics can be influenced by magnetic fields during geomagnetic conditions. However, the emphasis on navigation satellite systems and ionospheric conditions doesn't directly address your core research themes of magnetic field amplification and interactions in the interstellar medium.

### Investigation on upstream ion events from L1 point observation... New Insights
**Bijoy Dalal,Dibyendu Chakrabarty,Christina M. S. Cohen,Nandita Srivastava**


#plasma
### Abstract:
Origin of energetic upstream ions propagating towards the Sun from the Earths bow shock is not understood clearly. In this letter, relationship between solar wind suprathermal and upstream ions has been investigated by analyzing fluxes of H, 4He, and CNO obtained from multidirectional in-situ measurements at the first Lagrange point of the Sun-Earth system during 2012-2014. 49 upstream events have been selected based on flux enhancements of the upstream ions in comparison with the solar wind suprathermal ions. An energy cut-off at less than 300 keV is observed for the upstream events. This is attributed to the efficacy of the particle acceleration process near the bow shock. Interestingly, spectra of upstream ions soften systematically as compared to the spectra of their solar wind counterpart with decreasing mass of elements. The degree of spectral softening increases with decreasing mass-to-charge ratio of the species. Since during most of the events the interplanetary magnetic field was radial, we argue that cross-field diffusion of upstream ions gives rise to the modulation (spectral softening) of upstream ions, which is dependent on the mass-to-charge ratio of species. Our work indicates towards a systematic change in solar wind suprathermal ions after interaction with the bow shock.

### AI Justification:
The paper’s exploration of energetic upstream ions and their interactions with the solar wind near the Earth’s bow shock has some relevance to my interests in magnetic dynamics, particularly in its mention of “cross-field diffusion” and “interplanetary magnetic field.” However, the focus on upstream events and energy cut-offs does not align closely with my core research topics related to magnetic field amplification and the multi-scale dynamics of magnetic fields in astrophysical plasmas.

### Enhanced Peak and Extended Cooling of the Extreme-ultraviolet Late Phase in a Confined Solar Flare
**Shihan Li,Yu Dai,Mingde Ding,Jinhan Guo,Hao Wu**


#plasma
### Abstract:
We present observations and analysis of an X1.8 non-eruptive solar flare on 2012 October 23, which is characterized by an extremely large late-phase peak seen in the warm coronal extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) emissions ( $\sim$ 3 MK), with the peak intensity over 1.4 times that of main flare peak. The flare is driven by a failed eruption of a magnetic flux rope (MFR), whose strong squeeze force acting on the overlying magnetic structures gives rise to an intense early heating of the late-phase loops. Based on differential emission measure (DEM) analysis, it is found that the late-phase loops experience a `longer-than-expected` cooling without the presence of any obvious additional heating, and meanwhile, their volume emission measure (EM) maintains a plateau level for a long time before turning into an evident decay. Without the need for an additional heating, we propose that the special thermodynamic evolution of the late-phase loops revealed in this flare might arise from loop cross-sectional expansions with height, which are evidenced by both direct measurements from EUV images and by magnetic field extrapolation. By blocking the losses of both heat flux and mass from the corona, such an upward cross-sectional expansion not only elongates the loop cooling time, but also more effectively sustains the loop density, therefore leading to a later-than-expected occurrence of the warm coronal late phase in combination with a sufficiently high late-phase peak. We further verify such a scenario by analytically solving the cooling process of a late-phase loop characterized by a variable cross section.

### Asteroseismology
**Dominic M. Bowman,Lisa Bugnet**


#plasma
### Abstract:
Asteroseismology is the study of the interior physics and structure of stars using their pulsations. It is applicable to stars across the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram and a powerful technique to measure masses, radii and ages, but also directly constrain interior rotation, chemical mixing, and magnetism. This is because a stars self-excited pulsation modes are sensitive to its structure. Asteroseismology generally requires long-duration and high-precision time series data. The method of forward asteroseismic modelling, which is the statistical comparison of observed pulsation mode frequencies to theoretically predicted pulsation frequencies calculated from a grid of models, provides precise constraints for calibrating various transport phenomena. In this introduction to asteroseismology, we provide an overview of its principles, and the typical data sets and methodologies used to constrain stellar interiors. Finally, we present key highlights of asteroseismic results from across the HR diagram, and conclude with ongoing challenges and future prospects for this ever-expanding field within stellar astrophysics.

### Tracking on-the-fly massive black hole binary evolution and coalescence in galaxy simulations... RAMCOAL
**Kunyang Li,Marta Volonteri,Yohan Dubois,Ricarda Beckmann,Maxime Trebitsch**


#plasma
### Abstract:
The detection of gravitational waves (GWs) from massive black hole binary (MBHB) coalescence motivates the development of a sub-grid model. We present RAMCOAL, integrated into the RAMSES code, which simulates the orbital evolution of MBHBs, accounting for stellar and gaseous dynamical friction (DF), stellar scattering, circumbinary disk interactions, and GW emission at scales below the simulation resolution. Unlike post-processing approaches, RAMCOAL tracks the real-time evolution of MBHBs within hydrodynamical simulations of galaxies using local quantities to model dynamics and accretion. This enables more accurate predictions of both GW signals and the properties of merging black holes. We validate RAMCOAL across isolated and merging galaxy setups at resolutions of 10, 50, and 100 pc, with and without black hole accretion and feedback. In addition, we test the model in seven galaxy merger scenarios at 100 pc resolution. These tests demonstrate that RAMCOAL is largely resolution-independent and successfully captures the effects of DF from stars, dark matter, and gas, loss-cone scattering, viscous drag from circumbinary disks, and GW emission -- all within a realistic galactic environment, even at low resolutions. With RAMCOAL, we can better estimate MBHB coalescence rates and the GW background, while providing insights into the electromagnetic counterparts of GW sources. This approach bridges the gap between electromagnetic observations and GW detection, offering a more comprehensive understanding of MBHB evolution in cosmological simulations.

### Long-term evolution of spin and other properties of neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries... implications for millisecond X-ray pulsars
**Abhijnan Kar,Pulkit Ojha,Sudip Bhattacharyya**


#plasma
### Abstract:
A neutron star (NS) accreting matter from a companion star in a low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) system can spin up to become a millisecond pulsar (MSP). Properties of many such MSP systems are known, which is excellent for probing fundamental aspects of NS physics when modelled using the theoretical computation of NS LMXB evolution. Here, we systematically compute the long-term evolution of NS, binary and companion parameters for NS LMXBs using the stellar evolution code MESA. We consider the baryonic to gravitational mass conversion to calculate the NS mass evolution and show its cruciality for the realistic computation of some parameters. With computations using many combinations of parameter values, we find the general nature of the complex NS spin frequency ( $\nu$ ) evolution, which depends on various parameters, including accretion rate, fractional mass loss from the system, and companion star magnetic braking. Further, we utilize our results to precisely match some main observed parameters, such as $\nu$ , orbital period ( $P_{\rm orb}$ ), etc., of four accreting millisecond X-ray pulsars (AMXPs). By providing the $\nu$ , $P_{\rm orb}$ and the companion mass spaces for NS LMXB evolution, we indicate the distribution and plausible evolution of a few other AMXPs. We also discuss the current challenges in explaining the parameters of AMXP sources with brown dwarf companions and indicate the importance of modelling the transient accretion in LMXBs as a possible solution.

### A study of the electrostatic properties of the interiors of low-mass stars... Possible implications for the observed rotational properties
**Ana Brito,Ilidio Lopes**


#plasma
### Abstract:
In the partially ionized material of stellar interiors, the strongest forces acting on electrons and ions are the Coulomb interactions between charges. The dynamics of the plasma as a whole depend on the magnitudes of the average electrostatic interactions and the average kinetic energies of the particles that constitute the stellar material. An important question is how these interactions of real gases are related to the observable stellar properties. Specifically, the relationships between rotation, magnetic activity, and the thermodynamic properties of stellar interiors are still not well understood. In this study, we investigate the electrostatic effects within the interiors of low-mass main sequence (MS) stars. Specifically, we introduce a global quantity, a global plasma parameter, which allows us to compare the importance of electrostatic interactions across a range of low-mass theoretical models ( $0.7 - 1.4 \, M_\odot$ ) with varying ages and metallicities. We then correlate the electrostatic properties of the theoretical models with the observable rotational trends on the MS. We use the open-source 1D stellar evolution code MESA to compute a grid of main-sequence stellar models. Our models span the $\log g - T_{\text{eff}}$ space of a set of 66 Kepler main-sequence stars. We identify a correlation between the prominence of electrostatic effects in stellar interiors and stellar rotation rates. The variations in the magnitude of electrostatic interactions with age and metallicity further suggest that understanding the underlying physics of the collective effects of plasma can clarify key observational trends related to the rotation of low-mass stars on the MS. These results may also advance our understanding of the physics behind the observed weakened magnetic braking in stars.

### Manipulation of annular electron beams in plasmas
**Yangchun Liu,Dong Wu,Tianyi Liang,Zhengmao Sheng,Xiantu He**


#plasma
### Abstract:
The annular electron beam has significant practical potential in high-energy physics and condensed matter physics, which can be used to edge-enhancement electron imaging, collimation of antiprotons in conventional linear accelerators, acceleration of positively particles like positrons, structured X-ray generation and manipulation of nanomaterials. The quality of an annular electron beam depends on its energy, flux and topology. In this article, we study the transport characteristics of annular electron beam in a plasma medium and propose a scheme to modify it. According to our theory and full three-dimensional LAPINS simulations, we have found that the self-generated magnetic field focuses the incident annular electron beam, enabling the adjustment of its annular width (AW). Besides, the annular electron beam, endowed with orbital angular momentum (OAM), exhibits contrasting transport characteristics compared to an electron beam devoid of OAM. The former requires an external magnetic field to ensure stable transportation in the plasma. Under the influence of this magnetic field, the radius of the annular electron beam oscillates periodically, with the direction of change whether increasing or decreasing dependent on the fields strength. In this case, the radius of annular electron beam will be affected by the external magnetic field and allows for the simultaneous adjustment of its radius and AW, significantly broadening its application range.

### Deformation and breakup of a ferrofluid compound droplet migrating in a microchannel under a magnetic field... A phase-field-based multiple-relaxation time lattice Boltzmann study
**Parham Poureslami,Mohammad Majidi,Javad Ranjbar Kermani,Mohamad Ali Bijarchi**


#plasma
### Abstract:
Though ubiquitous in many engineering applications, including drug delivery, the compound droplet hydrodynamics in confined geometries have been barely surveyed. For the first time, this study thoroughly investigates the hydrodynamics of a ferrofluid compound droplet (FCD) during its migration in a microchannel under the presence of a pressure-driven flow and a uniform external magnetic field (UEMF) to manipulate its morphology and retard its breakup. Finite difference and phase-field multiple-relaxation time lattice Boltzmann approaches are coupled to determine the magnetic field and ternary flow system, respectively. Firstly, the influence of the magnetic Bond number (Bo) on the FCD morphology is explored depending on whether the core or shell is ferrofluid when the UEMF is applied along {\alpha}=0{\deg} and {\alpha}=90{\deg} relative to the fluid flow. It is ascertained that imposing the UEMF at {\alpha}=0{\deg} when the shell is ferrofluid can postpone the breakup. Intriguingly, when the core is ferrofluid, strengthening the UEMF enlarges the shell deformation. Afterward, the effects of the Capillary number (Ca), density ratio, viscosity ratio, radius ratio, and surface tension coefficients are scrutinized on the FCD deformation and breakup. The results indicate that augmenting the core-to-shell viscosity and density ratios accelerates the breakup process. Additionally, surface tension between the core and shell suppresses the core deformation. Moreover, increasing the Ca number intensifies the viscous drag force exerted on the shell, flattening its rear side, which causes a triangular-like configuration. Ultimately, by varying Bo and Ca numbers, five distinguished regimes are observed, whose regime map is established.

### Double-edged sword... the influence of tidal interaction on stellar activity in binaries
**Yuedan Ding,Shidi Zhang,Henggeng Han,Wenyuan Cui,Song Wang,Min Fang,...**


#plasma
### Abstract:
Using the LAMOST DR7 low-resolution spectra, we carried out a systematic study of stellar chromospheric activity in both single and binary stars. We constructed a binary sample and a single-star sample, mainly using the binary belt and the main sequence in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, respectively. By comparing the $S$ indices between single and binary stars within each color bin, we found for K type stars, binaries exhibit enhanced activity compared to single stars, which could be attributed to the increase in spin rate caused by tidal synchronization or to the interactions of magnetic fields. Both single stars and binaries fall on a common sequence in the activity-period relation, indicating that chromospheric activities of binaries are dominated by the more active components. More intriguingly, in some color ranges, a slight decline of the $S$ index for smaller orbital period was observed for binary stars. Although the possibility of sample selection effects cannot be excluded, this may mark the first example of super-saturation (i.e., caused by reduced active regions) being detected in chromospheric activity, or provide evidence of the suppressing effect on the magnetic dynamo and stellar activities by strong tidal interaction in very close binaries. Our study suggests that tidal interaction acts as a double-edged sword in relation to stellar activities.

However, the main focus appears to be on stellar chromospheric activity rather than the broader plasma dynamics or multi-scale interactions in interstellar magnetic fields that are central to your research interests.

### Searching for Axion-Like Particles with X-ray Observations of Alpha Centauri
**Yu-Xuan Chen,Lei Lei,Zi-Qing Xia,Ziwei Wang,Yue-Lin Sming Tsai,Yi-Zhong Fan**


#plasma
### Abstract:
We investigate the production of axion-like particles (ALPs) in stellar cores, where they interact with electromagnetic fields and electrons, with typical masses between $\mathcal O(0.1)$ and $\mathcal O(10)$ keV. These low-energy ALPs are gravitationally trapped in the orbits of stars and subsequently decay into two photons that we detect as monochromatic X-ray lines. We propose to search for these gravitationally trapped ALPs in the Alpha Centauri binary system, our closest stellar neighbor, using sensitive X-ray detectors like Chandra and eROSITA. Our search for ALP decay signals in the energy range of 0.2 keV to 10 keV yielded null results, thus establishing the most stringent limits on ALP interactions to date. Specifically, if ALPs are mainly produced by Compton or bremsstrahlung processes (ALP-electron coupling $g_{aee}$ being significant), we have improved the limits on the ALP-photon coupling $g_{a\gamma\gamma}$ by two to three orders of magnitude, in ALP mass range between 0.2 keV to 5 keV, compared to previous measurements, including those from GW170817, SN 2023ixf, and other sources.

We consider the issue of strict, fully discrete \emph{local} energy conservation for a whole class of fully implicit local-charge- and global-energy-conserving particle-in-cell (PIC) algorithms. Earlier studies demonstrated these algorithms feature strict global energy conservation. However, whether a local energy conservation theorem exists (in which the local energy update is governed by a flux balance equation at every mesh cell) for these schemes is unclear. In this study, we show that a local energy conservation theorem indeed exists. We begin our analysis with the 1D electrostatic PIC model without orbit-averaging, and then generalize our conclusions to account for orbit averaging, multiple dimensions, and electromagnetic models (Darwin). In all cases, a temporally, spatially, and particle-discrete local energy conservation theorem is shown to exist, proving that these formulations (as originally proposed in the literature), in addition to being locally charge conserving, are strictly locally energy conserving as well. In contrast to earlier proofs of local conservation in the literature \citep{xiao2017local}, which only considered continuum time, our result is valid for the fully implicit time-discrete version of all models, including important features such as orbit averaging. We demonstrate the local-energy-conservation property numerically with a paradigmatic numerical example.

### AI Justification:
This paper primarily discusses energy conservation in particle-in-cell (PIC) algorithms, which may not directly relate to your focus on the magnetic dynamics of plasmas in the interstellar medium. However, the mention of “electromagnetic models” and the concern with “local energy conservation” could be tangentially relevant to understanding dynamics in plasma environments, even if it doesn't specifically address magnetic fields or their amplification as you outline in your interests.

### Further study of starspot activity and measurement of differential rotation for SZ Piscium
**Yue Xiang,Shenghong Gu,A. Collier Cameron,J. R. Barnes,Dongtao Cao**


#plasma
### Abstract:
We present a series of 9 Doppler images of the magnetically active K component of the RS CVn-type binary SZ Psc, based on the high-resolution spectroscopic data collected from 2014 to 2018. We apply least-squares deconvolution to all spectra to extract the average profiles with high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) for Doppler imaging. The surface maps of the K subgiant show starspots widely distributed along latitude and longitude. A prominent, non-axisymmetric polar spot around phase 0 is revealed by all images with sufficient phase coverage, which may be a stable feature on the K component. The starspots evolve in a time scale of one month. We have determined the surface shear rate of the K component from the starspot maps reconstructed 10 days apart in 2017 Nov--Dec, through the cross-correlation method. The surface differential rotation parameters are $\Omega_{eq} = 1.591 \pm 0.002 $ rad d $ ^{-1} $ and $ \Delta \Omega = 0.035 \pm 0.003 $ rad d $ ^{-1}$ . The absorption lines contributed from the tertiary component are detected in all LSD profiles of SZ Psc, and we measure the radial velocity of the binary system and the tertiary component to derive an elliptical orbit with a period of $1530 \pm 3 $ days and a mass of $ 0.75 \pm 0.06 $ M $ \odot$ for the tertiary component.

### Electron-ion model of ball and bead lightning
**Sergey G. Fedosin**


#plasma
### Abstract:
Based on the electron-ion model, parameters of ball and bead lightning are calculated. The model allows us to estimate maximum size of ball lightning, its energy content, electric charge and magnetic field, to determine equilibrium conditions between positively charged ions located inside and outer shell containing rapidly moving electrons. An explanation is given to the fact that shells are observed inside ball lightning that differ from each other in color of glow. The model describes structure of not only ball lightning, but also bead lightning. The long-term stability of bead lightning is associated with the balance of neighboring beads under action of magnetic force of their attraction and electric force of repulsion, which exceed in magnitude the force of wind pressure.

### AI Justification:
The paper presents an electron-ion model that calculates parameters of ball and bead lightning, including their magnetic fields, which may provide insight into "how magnetic fields behave" in non-standard plasma environments. However, while the study discusses magnetic forces, it does not address the more extensive magnetic dynamics or amplification mechanisms relevant to "interstellar medium" plasmas, thus offering only limited value to your research focus.

### Mergers of compact objects with cores of massive stars... evolution, r-process and multi-messenger signatures
**Aldana Grichener**


#plasma
### Abstract:
The study of massive binary systems has steadily progressed over the past decades, with increasing focus on their evolution, interactions and mergers, driven by improvements in computational modelling and observational techniques. In particular, when a binary system involves a massive giant and a neutron star (NS) or a black hole (BH) that go through common envelope evolution (CEE), it might results in the merger of the compact object with the core of its giant companion, giving rise to various high energy astrophysical phenomena. We review the different evolutionary channels that lead to compact objects-core mergers, key physical processes with emphasis on the role of accretion physics, feasibility of r-process nucleosynthesis, expected observable electromagnetic, neutrinos and gravitational-waves (GWs) signatures, as well as potential correlation with detected core collapse supernovae (CCSNe), luminous fast blue optical transients (LFBOTs) and low luminosity long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs). After presenting our current understanding of these mergers, we conclude discussing prospects for future advancements.


![[mdfiles/2410.18813.md|2410.18813]]
### AI Justification:
This paper, while primarily focused on the evolution and observational outcomes of compact object mergers, briefly touches upon the "key physical processes" involved in these interactions, which could implicate magnetic dynamics in the accretion physics and energetic phenomena produced during such events. However, it does not directly address the amplification, interactions, or turbulence-driven behaviors of magnetic fields in plasmas, which are central to your research interest in "magnetic dynamics of plasmas in the interstellar medium."

### Ultraviolet extinction correlation with 3D dust maps using white dwarfs
**Snehalata Sahu,Pier-Emmanuel Tremblay,Rosine Lallement,Seth Redfield,Boris T. Gaensicke**


#plasma
### Abstract:
Accurate astrometric and photometric measurements from Gaia have led to the construction of 3D dust extinction maps which can now be used for estimating the integrated extinctions of Galactic sources located within 5 kpc. These maps based on optical observations may not be reliable for use in the ultraviolet (UV) which is more sensitive to reddening. Past studies have focused on studying UV extinction using main-sequence stars but lack comparison with 3D dust maps. White dwarfs with well-modeled hydrogen-dominated (DA) atmospheres provide an advantage over main-sequence stars affected by magnetic activity. In this work, we study the variation of UV extinction with 3D dust maps utilising HST and GALEX observations of DA white dwarfs located within 300 pc. We used HST COS spectroscopic data of 76 sight lines to calculate the optical extinction from Si II column densities and validate our results with the kinematic model predictions of the local interstellar medium. Also, we combined GALEX and Gaia photometric observations of 1158 DA white dwarfs to study UV reddening by comparing observed and modeled colour-colour relations. We calculated GALEX non-linearity corrections and derived reddening coefficients (R(NUV-G) = 6.52 +/- 1.53 and R(FUV-G) = 6.04 +/- 2.41) considering their variations with optical extinction (Av < 0.1 mag), and found them to be in good agreement with known extinction laws. HST analysis suggests a positive bias of 0.01-0.02 mag in the optical extinction from 3D maps depending on the Galactic latitude. These results independently confirm the validity of 3D dust maps to deredden the optical and UV observations of white dwarfs.


![[mdfiles/2410.10358.md|2410.10358]]
### AI Justification:
The paper primarily focuses on UV extinction and the analysis of 3D dust maps utilizing white dwarfs, which is somewhat relevant to astrophysics but does not directly address the core research interests stated in your prompt. Specifically, while it mentions interaction with the interstellar medium and validates models related to dust extinction, it lacks direct exploration of magnetic field amplification, force interactions shaping magnetic dynamics, or emergent magnetic behaviors in plasmas as per your outlined interests.

### Explaining Non-Merger Gamma-Ray Bursts and Broad-Lined Supernovae with Close Binary Progenitors with Black Hole Central Engine
**Christopher L. Fryer,Eric Burns,Anna Y. Q. Ho,Amy Y. Lien,Daniel A. Perley,Jada L. Vail,...**


#plasma
### Abstract:
For over 25 years, the origin of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (lGRBs) has been linked to the collapse of rotating massive stars. However, we have yet to pinpoint the stellar progenitor powering these transients. Moreover, the dominant engine powering the explosions remains open to debate. Observations of both lGRBs, supernovae associated with these GRBs, such as broad-line (BL) stripped-envelope (type Ic) supernovae (hereafter, Ic-BL) supernovae (SNe) and perhaps superluminous SNe, fast blue optical transients, and fast x-ray transients, may provide clues to both engines and progenitors. In this paper, we conduct a detailed study of the tight-binary formation scenario for lGRBs, comparing this scenario to other leading progenitor models. Combining this progenitor scenario with different lGRB engines, we can compare to existing data and make predictions for future observational tests. We find that the combination of the tight-binary progenitor scenario with the black hole accretion disk (BHAD) engine can explain lGRBs, low-luminosity GRBs, ultra-long GRBs, and Ic-BL. We discuss the various progenitor properties required for these different subclasses and note such systems would be future gravitational wave merger sources. We show that the current literature on other progenitor-engine scenarios cannot explain all of these transient classes with a single origin, motivating additional work. We find that the tight-binary progenitor with a magnetar engine is excluded by existing observations. The observations can be used to constrain the properties of stellar evolution, the nature of the GRB and the associated SN engines in lGRBs and Ic-BL. We discuss the future observations needed to constrain our understanding of these rare, but powerful, explosions.

### Emergent dynamics and spatiotemporal patterns in soft robotic swarms
**R. Pramanik,R. W. C. P. Verstappen,P. R. Onck**


#plasma
### Abstract:
The collective swimming of soft robots in an infinite viscous fluid is an emergent phenomenon due to the non-reciprocal hydrodynamic interactions between individual swimmers. These physical interactions give rise to unique spatiotemporal patterns and unusual swimming trajectories that are often difficult to predict due to the two-way fully coupled nature of the strong fluid-structure interaction at a thermodynamic state that is far from equilibrium. Until now, robotic swarms have mostly been studied for rigid swimmers in two-dimensional settings. Here we study the emergence of three-dimensional spatiotemporal patterns of helical magnetically actuated soft-robotic swimmers by systematically studying the effect of different initial configurations. Our results show that swimmers with variations in initial positions in the swimming direction are attracted to each other, while swimmers with variations in lateral positions repel each other, eventually converging to a state in which all swimmers concentrate in one lateral plane drifting radially outward.

### Diffusive interactions between photons and electrons... an application to cosmology
**L. Marmet**


#plasma
### Abstract:
The gradient force is the conservative component of many types of forces exerted by light on particles. When it is derived from a potential, there is no heat transferred to the particle interacting with the light field. However, most theoretical descriptions of the gradient force use simplified configurations of the light field and particle interactions which overlook small amounts of heating. It is known that quantum fluctuations contribute to a very small but measurable momentum diffusion of atoms and a corresponding increase in their temperature. This paper examines the contribution to momentum diffusion from a gradient force described as a quantum interaction between electron wave packets and a classical electromagnetic field. Stimulated transfers of photons between interfering light beams produce a small amount of heating that is difficult to detect in laboratory experiments. However the solar corona, with its thermal electrons irradiated by an intense electromagnetic field, provides ideal conditions for such a measurement. Heating from stimulated transfers is calculated to contribute a large fraction of the observed coronal heating. Furthermore, the energy removed from the light field produces a wavelength shift of its spectrum as it travels through free electrons. Theory predicts a stimulated transfer redshift comparable to the redshift of distant objects observed in astronomy.

### Thermodynamics of a newly constructed black hole coupled with nonlinear electrodynamics and cloud of strings
**Himanshu Kumar Sudhanshu,Dharm Veer Singh,Sudhaker Upadhyay,Yerlan Myrzakulov,Kairat Myrzakulov**


#plasma
### Abstract:
This paper finds an exact singular black hole solution in the presence of nonlinear electrodynamics as the source of matter field surrounded by a cloud of strings in $4D$ $AdS$ spacetime. Here, the presence of the cloud of string, the usual Bardeen solution, becomes singular. The obtained black hole solution interpolates with the $AdS$ Letelier black hole in the absence of both the deviation parameter and magnetic charge and interpolates with the $AdS$ Bardeen black hole in the absence of the deviation parameter and a cloud of strings parameter. We analyse the horizon structure and thermodynamics properties, including the stability of the resulting black hole, numerically and graphically. Thermodynamical quantities associated with the black hole get modified due to the nonlinear electrodynamics and cloud of strings. Moreover, we study the effect of a cloud of strings parameter, magnetic charge and deviation parameter on critical points and phase transition of the obtained black hole where the cosmological constant is treated as the thermodynamics pressure. The critical radius increases with increasing deviation parameter values and magnetic charge values. In contrast, the critical pressure and temperature decrease with increasing deviation parameters and magnetic charge values.

### The Solar Neighborhood LII... M Dwarf Twin Binaries -- Presumed Identical Twins Appear Fraternal in Variability, Rotation, H $α$ , and X-rays
**Andrew A. Couperus,Todd J. Henry,Rachel A. Osten,Wei-Chun Jao,Eliot Halley Vrijmoet,Aman Kar,...**


#plasma
### Abstract:
We present an investigation into the rotation and stellar activity of four fully convective M dwarf `twin wide binaries. Components in each pair have (1) astrometry confirming they are common-proper-motion binaries, (2) Gaia $BP$ , $RP$ , and 2MASS $J$ , $H$ , and $K_s$ magnitudes matching within 0.10 mag, and (3) presumably the same age and composition. We report long-term photometry, rotation periods, multi-epoch H $\alpha$ equivalent widths, X-ray luminosities, time series radial velocities, and speckle observations for all components. Although it might be expected for the twin components to have matching magnetic attributes, this is not the case. Decade-long photometry of GJ 1183 AB indicates consistently higher spot activity on A than B, a trend matched by A appearing 58 $\pm$ 9% stronger in $L_X$ and 26 $\pm$ 9% stronger in H $\alpha$ on average -- this is despite similar rotation periods of A=0.86d and B=0.68d, thereby informing the range in activity for otherwise identical and similarly-rotating M dwarfs. The young $\beta$ Pic Moving Group member 2MA 0201+0117 AB displays a consistently more active B component that is 3.6 $\pm$ 0.5 times stronger in $L_X$ and 52 $\pm$ 19% stronger in H $\alpha$ on average, with distinct rotation at A=6.01d and B=3.30d. Finally, NLTT 44989 AB displays remarkable differences with implications for spindown evolution -- B has sustained H $\alpha$ emission while A shows absorption, and B is $\geq$ 39 $\pm$ 4 times stronger in $L_X$ , presumably stemming from the surprisingly different rotation periods of A=38d and B=6.55d. The last system, KX Com, has an unresolved radial velocity companion, and is therefore not a twin system.

### Charge ratio of cosmic ray muons in momentum range ~ 1 to 3 GeV/c
**Raj Shah,J. M. John,Suryanarayan Mondal,S. Pethuraj,G. Majumder,P. Shukla**


#plasma
### Abstract:
This work presents the measurements of the cosmic muon charge ratio as a function of full azimuthal angle and momentum within the range of 0.8 to 3.0 GeV/c, using the mini-ICAL detector. The detector, comprising 10 layers of RPCs, has collected cosmic muon data since August 2018 till recent time, at an altitude of 160 m above sea level at the Inter-Institutional Center for High Energy Physics in Madurai, India $(9^\circ56\,N, 78^\circ00\,E)$ . The muon charge identification is achieved through the use of a magnetic field of strength 1.4 T. The analysis shows that the cosmic muon charge ratio, $R_\mu = N_{\mu^+}/N_{\mu^-}$ , ranges from 1.1 to 1.2 and has small dependency on the zenith angle. The charge ratios dependence on momentum and azimuthal angle is thoroughly examined for a wide range of zenith angle upto $50^\circ$ . These measurements are compared with the predictions from various combinations of different hadronic models in CORSIKA extensive air shower simulations.

### KM UMa... An active short-period detached eclipsing binary in a hierarchical quadruple system
**Fangbin Meng,Liying Zhu,Nianping Liu,Ping Li,Jia Zhang,Linjia Li,...**


#plasma
### Abstract:
The first detailed photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the G-type eclipsing binary KM UMa is presented, which indicates that the system is a short-period detached eclipsing binary. The radial velocity curves were calculated using the cross-correlation function method based on Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope, Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and our observations, which determined the mass ratio as $q=0.45\ (\pm0.04)$ . Based on the light curves from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, other survey data, and our multiband observations, the positive and negative OConnell effects have been detected evolving gradually and alternately over the last 20 yr, which can be explained by the presence of spots on the primary component. A superflare event was detected in the SuperWASP data on 2007 February 28, further indicating that KM UMa is a very active system. We calculated its energy to be $5\times10^{34}$ erg by assuming it occurred on the primary star. Utilizing hundreds of medium-resolution spectra and one low-resolution spectrum, the equivalent width variations of the $H_{\alpha}$ line were calculated, indicating the presence of a 5.21 ( $\pm0.67$ ) yr magnetic activity cycle. The orbital period variations were analyzed using the O-C method, detecting a long-term decrease superimposed with a periodic variation. The amplitude of the cyclic variation is $0.01124\ (\pm0.00004)$ day, with a period of $33.66\ (\pm 0.0012)$ yr, which exceeds the 5.21 yr activity cycle, suggesting that this is more likely attributable to the light travel time effect of a third body. Simultaneously, a visual companion has been detected based on the Gaia astrometric data, indicating that KM UMa is actually in a 2+1+1 hierarchical quadruple system.

### Potential Flows with Electromagnetically-Induced Circulation in a Hele-Shaw Cell
**Kyle I. McKee,John W. M. Bush**


#plasma
### Abstract:
In Hele-Shaw cells, pressure-driven viscous fluid motion between two closely-spaced plates gives rise to a two-dimensional potential flow with zero circulation. Here, we show how the introduction of electromagnetic effects enables the realization of potential flows with circulation. We present canonical Hele-Shaw experiments with circulation prescribed by the electromagnetic configuration, and rationalize the observed flows theoretically. We also draw an analogy between this new class of circulatory potential flows and a class of electrostatic systems.

### AI Justification:
The paper's focus on "electromagnetically-induced circulation" presents a unique exploration of electromagnetic effects, which could tangentially relate to magnetic field behavior in plasma environments, but it lacks a direct examination of "magnetic dynamics" or "interstellar magnetic fields." Given my emphasis on the interplay between "magnetic fields," "force interactions," and "emergent dynamics in turbulent plasmas," this paper does not align closely enough with my research interests on magnetic amplification and behavior in astrophysical contexts.

### Extending the Asteroseismic Calibration of the Stellar Rossby Number
**Travis S. Metcalfe,Enrico Corsaro,Alfio Bonanno,Orlagh L. Creevey,Jennifer L. van Saders**


#plasma
### Abstract:
The stellar Rossby number (Ro) is a dimensionless quantity that is used in the description of fluid flows. It characterizes the relative importance of Coriolis forces on convective motions, which is central to understanding magnetic stellar evolution. Here we present an expanded sample of Kepler asteroseismic targets to help calibrate the relation between Ro and Gaia color, and we extend the relation to redder colors using observations of the mean activity levels and rotation periods for a sample of brighter stars from the Mount Wilson survey. Our quadratic fit to the combined sample is nearly linear between 0.55 < G_BP-G_RP < 1.2, and can be used to estimate Ro for stars with spectral types between F5 and K3. The strong deviation from linearity in the original calibration may reflect an observational bias against the detection of solar-like oscillations at higher activity levels for the coolest stars.

### AI Justification:
This paper appears to have low relevance to your interests in theoretical astrophysics and plasma physics, as it primarily focuses on the relationship between the stellar Rossby number and stellar activity rather than addressing magnetic dynamics in plasmas. The abstract discusses "Coriolis forces" and "convective motions" in the context of stellar evolution, but it does not touch on themes such as "magnetic field amplification," "force interactions," or the "emergent magnetic dynamics in turbulent plasmas" which are central to your research objectives.

### Spin and Obliquity Evolution of Hot Jupiter Hosts from Resonance Locks
**J. J. Zanazzi,Eugene Chiang**


#plasma
### Abstract:
When a hot Jupiter orbits a star whose effective temperature exceeds $\sim$ 6100 K, its orbit normal tends to be misaligned with the stellar spin axis. Cooler stars have smaller obliquities. The latter may have been damped by hot Jupiters in resonance lock with axisymmetric stellar gravity modes (azimuthal number $m=0$ ), as has been recently recognized. Here we allow for resonance locks with non-axisymmetric modes, which affect both stellar obliquity and spin frequency. Obliquities damp for all modes ( $-2 \leq m \leq 2 $ ). Stars spin up for $ m > 0 $ , and spin down for $ m < 0$ . We carry out a population synthesis that assumes hot Jupiters form misaligned around both cool and hot stars, and subsequently lock onto modes whose $m$ -values yield the highest mode energies for given starting obliquities. Core hydrogen burning enables hot Jupiters to torque low-mass stars, but not high-mass stars, into spin-orbit alignment. Resonance locking plus stellar spin-down from magnetic braking largely reproduces observed obliquities and stellar rotation rates and how they trend with stellar effective temperature and orbital separation.

### AI Justification:
The paper focuses on the interaction between stellar parameters and the orbital characteristics of hot Jupiters, which primarily concerns spin and resonance locking, and does not directly address the behavior, interaction, or amplification of magnetic fields within plasma environments. This thematic disconnect from your research interests in "Magnetic Field Amplification" and "Emergent Magnetic Dynamics in Turbulent Plasmas" suggests that it is unlikely to provide valuable insights pertinent to your work.

### Hot Subdwarf Stars
**Ulrich Heber**


#plasma
### Abstract:
Hot subdwarf (SD) stars are the stripped cores of red giant stars in transition to the white dwarf sequence. The B-type subdwarfs (sdB) are powered by helium fusion in the core, more evolved ones (sdO) by shell burning. Low mass SDs may evolve through this stage without any support by nuclear fusion. Because the loss of the giants envelopes is likely caused by mass transfer in binaries, hot SDs are test beds for close-binary evolution through stable and unstable Roche lobe overflow, common envelope formation and ejection as well as mergers. Many classes of hot SDs can be identified according to surface composition, binarity, magnetism, pulsation characteristics and population membership, including members of globular clusters. Observed binaries show a wide spread of orbital periods from 20 minutes to more than 1,000 days with white dwarf or main sequence companions. The closest systems qualify as type Ia supernova progenitors and LISA detectable gravitational wave sources. High-precision light curves from Kepler and TESS combined with radial velocity curves are used to derive masses, while asteroseismology adds information on the internal structure, slow rotation, and synchronization. Gaias parallax measurements now allow us to place the stars in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and derive stellar parameters by combining them with multi-band photometry. The stellar radius can be determined to high precision this way. Newtons law can then be used to derive masses if accurate surface gravities are available. Large-scale spectroscopic surveys will provide atmospheric parameters for large samples of stars, allowing the mass distributions for the diverse subtypes to be established. These are crucial for testing binary synthesis models and constraining poorly known parameters such as the common envelope efficiency as well as the critical threshold mass-ratio for mass transfer stability.

### AI Justification:
The paper's abstract primarily addresses the evolution and characteristics of hot subdwarf stars, touching on aspects like binarity and the role of mass transfer in binaries but lacks a focus on the magnetic dynamics of plasmas, which is central to your research interests in astrophysics. Key phrases such as "magnetic dynamics" and "magnetic field amplification" from your research prompt are not present in the abstract, indicating a significant misalignment with your focus on the interactions and behaviors of magnetic fields in astrophysical plasmas.

### Evolution of Cataclysmic Variables with Binary-Driven Mass-Loss during Nova Eruptions
**Wen-Shi Tang,Xiang-dong Li,Zhe Cui**


#plasma
### Abstract:
The discrepancies between observations and theoretical predictions of cataclysmic variables (CVs) suggest that there exists unknown angular momentum loss mechanism(s) besides magnetic braking and gravitational radiation. Mass loss due to nova eruptions belongs to the most likely candidates. While standard theory assumes that mass is lost in the form of radiation driven, optically thick wind (fast wind; FW), recent numerical simulations indicate that most of the mass loss is initiated and shaped by binary interaction. We explore the effect of this binary-driven mass-loss (BDML) on the CV evolutions assuming a major fraction of the lost mass leaves the system from the outer Lagrangian point. Different from the traditional continuous wind picture, we consider the mass loss process to be instantaneous, because the duration of nova eruptions is much shorter than the binary evolutionary timescale. Our detailed binary evolution calculations reveal the following results. (1) BDML seems able to provide extra angular momentum loss below the period gap. The mass transfer rates at a given orbital period occupy a large range, in agreement with the observed secular mass transfer rate distribution in CVs. (2) The enhanced mass transfer rates do not lead to runaway mass transfer process, and allow the white dwarfs to grow mass $\lesssim 0.1\,M_{\odot}$ . (3) BDML can cause both positive and negative variations of the orbital period induced by nova eruptions, in line with observations, and can potentially explain the properties of some peculiar supersoft X-ray sources likely CAL 87, 1E 0035.4 $-$ 7230, and RX J0537.7 $-$ 7034.

### AI Justification:
Although the paper discusses the binary interactions and mass loss in cataclysmic variables, it primarily focuses on binary-driven mass-loss mechanisms during nova eruptions, which does not align closely with your research interests in the "magnetic dynamics of plasmas" nor the "interstellar medium." Since your focus is on the behavior and amplification of magnetic fields across various scales, particularly regarding "interactions between magnetic, gravitational, and thermal forces," this paper appears to provide minimal insights related to your theoretical models or simulations.

### Acoustothermal Effect... Mechanism and Quantification of the Heat Source
**Pradipta Kr. Das,Venkat R. Bhethanabotla**


#plasma
### Abstract:
We examined theoretically, experimentally and numerically the origin of the acoustothermal effect using a standing surface acoustic wave actuated sessile water droplet system. Despite a wealth of experimental studies and a few recent theoretical explorations, a profound understanding of the acoustothermal mechanism remains elusive. This study bridges the existing knowledge gap by pinpointing the fundamental causes of acoustothermal heating. Theory broadly applicable to any acoustofluidic system at arbitrary Reynolds numbers going beyond the regular perturbation analysis is presented. Relevant parameters responsible for the phenomenon are identified and an exact closed form expression delineating the underlining mechanism is presented. Furthermore, an analogy between the acoustothermal effect and electromagnetic heating is drawn, thereby deepening understanding of the acoustothermal process.

### AI Justification:
This paper appears to have low relevance to your research focus in theoretical astrophysics and plasma physics, as it primarily investigates the acoustothermal effect in fluid systems rather than magnetic dynamics in plasmas. While it mentions "an analogy between the acoustothermal effect and electromagnetic heating," this connection does not align closely with your interests in "magnetic field amplification" or "emergent magnetic dynamics in turbulent plasmas."

### The Third Konus-Wind Catalog of Short Gamma-Ray bursts
**Alexandra L. Lysenko,Dmitry S. Svinkin,Dmitry D. Frederiks,Anna V. Ridnaia,Anastasia E. Tsvetkova,Mikhail V. Ulanov**


#plasma
### Abstract:
In this catalog, we present the results of a systematic study of 199 short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) detected by Konus-Wind between 2011 January 1 and 2021 August 31. The catalog extends the Second Catalog of short gamma-ray bursts covering the period 1994-2010 by ten years of data. The resulting Konus-Wind short GRB sample includes 494 bursts. From temporal and spectral analyses of the sample, we provide the burst durations, spectral lags, estimates of the minimum variability time scales, rise and decay times, the results of spectral fits with three model functions, the total energy fluences, and the peak energy fluxes of the bursts. We present statistical distributions of these parameters for the complete set of 494 short gamma-ray bursts detected in 1994-2021. We discuss evidence found for an additional spectral component and the presence of extended emission in a fraction of the short GRBs. Finally, we consider the results in the context of the Type I (merger-origin)/Type II (collapsar-origin) classification, and discuss magnetar giant flare sub-sample.

### Laser-FLASH... radiobiology at high dose, ultra-high dose-rate, single pulse laser-driven proton source
**A. Flacco,E. Bayart,C. Giaccaglia,J. Monzac,L. Romagnani,M. Cavallone,...**


#plasma
### Abstract:
Laser-driven proton sources have long been developed with an eye on their potential for medical application to radiation therapy. These sources are compact, versatile, and show peculiar characteristics such as extreme instantaneous dose rates, short duration and broad energy spectrum. Typical temporal modality of laser-driven irradiation, the so-called fast-fractionation, results from the composition of multiple, temporally separated, ultra-short dose fractions. In this paper we present the use of a high-energy laser system for delivering the target dose in a single nanosecond pulse, for ultra-fast irradiation of biological samples. A transport line composed by two permanent magnet quadrupoles and a scattering system is used to improve the dose profile and to control the delivered dose-per-pulse. A single-shot dosimetry protocol for the broad-spectrum proton source using Monte Carlo simulations was developed. Doses as high as 20Gy could be delivered in a single shot, lasting less than 10ns over a 1.0cm diameter sample holder, at a dose-rate exceeding 10^9 Gy/s. Exploratory application of extreme laser-driven irradiation conditions, falling within the FLASH irradiation protocol, are presented for in vitro and in vivo irradiation. A reduction of radiation-induced oxidative stress in-vitro and radiation-induced developmental damage in vivo were observed, whereas anti-tumoral efficacy was confirmed by cell survival assay.

### Modal analysis of blood flows in saccular aneurysms
**Thien-Tam Nguyen,Davina Kasperski,Phat Kim Huynh,Trung Quoc Le,Trung Bao Le**


#plasma
### Abstract:
Currently, it is challenging to investigate aneurismal hemodynamics based on current in-vivo data such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging or Computed Tomography due to the limitations in both spatial and temporal resolutions. In this work, we investigate the use of modal analysis at various resolutions to examine its usefulness for analyzing blood flows in brain aneurysms. Two variants of Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD)... (i) Hankel-DMD; and (ii) Optimized-DMD, are used to extract the time-dependent dynamics of blood flows during one cardiac cycle. First, high-resolution hemodynamic data in patient-specific aneurysms are obtained using Computational Fluid Dynamics. Second, the dynamics modes, along with their spatial amplitudes and temporal magnitudes are calculated using the DMD analysis. Third, an examination of DMD analyses using a range of spatial and temporal resolutions of hemodynamic data to validate the applicability of DMD for low-resolution data, similar to ones in clinical practices. Our results show that DMD is able to characterize the inflow jet dynamics by separating large-scale structures and flow instabilities even at low spatial and temporal resolutions. Its robustness in quantifying the flow dynamics using the energy spectrum is demonstrated across different resolutions in all aneurysms in our study population. Our work indicates that DMD can be used for analyzing blood flow patterns of brain aneurysms and is a promising tool to be explored in in-vivo.
