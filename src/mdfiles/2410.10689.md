abstract: Ising machines are an emerging class of hardware that promises ultrafast
  and energy-efficient solutions to NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems. Spatial
  photonic Ising machines (SPIMs) exploit optical computing in free space to accelerate
  the computation, showcasing parallelism, scalability, and low power consumption.
  However, current SPIMs can implement only a restricted class of problems. This partial
  programmability is a critical limitation that hampers their benchmark. Achieving
  full programmability of the device while preserving its scalability is an open challenge.
  Here, we report a fully programmable SPIM achieved through a novel operation method
  based on the division of the focal plane. In our scheme, a general Ising problem
  is decomposed into a set of Mattis Hamiltonians, whose energies are simultaneously
  computed optically by measuring the intensity on different regions of the camera
  sensor. Exploiting this concept, we experimentally demonstrate the computation with
  high success probability of ground-state solutions of up to 32-spin Ising models
  on unweighted maximum cut graphs with and without ferromagnetic bias. Simulations
  of the hardware prove a favorable scaling of the accuracy with the number of spins.
  Our fully programmable SPIM enables the implementation of many quadratic unconstrained
  binary optimization problems, further establishing SPIMs as a leading paradigm in
  non von Neumann hardware.

ai_reason: The paper discusses the development of a fully programmable Spatial Photonic
  Ising Machine, which exploits optical computing in free space, aligning with your
  interest in Free Space Optical Communication technologies. However, while it refers
  to using optical techniques, it does not mention Adaptive Optics, wavefront sensing
  technologies, or photonic lanterns, which are key aspects of your research focus.
