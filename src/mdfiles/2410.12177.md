abstract: This paper presents a novel heterodyne grating interferometer designed to
  meet the precise measurement requirements of next-generation lithography systems
  and large-scale atomic-level manufacturing. Utilizing a dual-frequency light source,
  the interferometer enables simultaneous measurement of three degrees of freedom.
  Key advancements include a compact zero Dead-Zone optical path configuration, significantly
  enhancing measurement reliability by mitigating the impact of light source fluctuations
  and air refractive index variations. A comprehensive crosstalk error analysis was
  conducted, resulting in a robust correction algorithm that reduces errors to below
  5%. Performance testing of the prototype, size of 90mm*90mm*40mm, demonstrated exceptional
  resolution (0.25 nm in the XY-axis and 0.3 nm in the Z-axis), superior linearity
  (6.9e-5, 8.1e-5 and 16.2e-5 for the X, Y, and Z axes, respectively), high repeatability
  (0.8 nm/1000 nm for the three axes) and stability (20 nm for the XY-axis and 60
  nm for the Z-axis over 1000 seconds). Comparative analysis with existing measurement
  sensors highlights the proposed methods significant advantages in integration, multidimensional
  capabilities, and is expected to be widely used in fields such as integrated circuits,
  atomic-level manufacturing and aerospace technology.
