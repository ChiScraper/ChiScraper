abstract: We present a detailed derivation of the Poynting vector for Cauchy-Riemann
  beams propagating in free space considering a Gaussian modulation with $g \in \mathbb{C}$
  . The effect generated by this Gaussian modulation is a compression-expansion of
  the intensity distribution. It is shown that the parameter $g$ can reverse the direction
  of energy flux and eliminate the radial component, resulting in a purely azimuthal
  field. Additionally, we validate our analytical results through experimental verification.

ai_reason: "The paper discusses the Poynting vector for Cauchy-Riemann beams and their\
  \ propagation in free space, which is relevant as it pertains to Free Space Optical\
  \ Communication\u2014a key area of your research. However, it lacks direct connections\
  \ to Adaptive Optics, wavefront sensing, or any of the specific technologies like\
  \ optic fiber bundles or photonic lanterns that you are currently focusing on, making\
  \ it somewhat peripheral to your interests."
