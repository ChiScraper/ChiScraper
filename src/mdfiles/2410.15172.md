abstract: The demand for structured light with a reconfigurable spatial and polarization
  distribution has been increasing across a wide range of fundamental and advanced
  photonics applications, including microscopy, imaging, sensing, communications,
  and quantum information processing. Nevertheless, the unique challenge in manipulating
  light structure after optical fiber transmission is the necessity to dynamically
  address the inherent unknown fiber transmission matrix, which can be affected by
  factors like variations in the fiber stress and inter-modal coupling. In this study,
  we demonstrated that the beam structure at the fiber end including its spatial and
  polarization distribution can be precisely and adaptively reconfigured by a programmable
  silicon photonic processor, without prior knowledge of the optical fiber systems
  and their changes in the transmission matrices. Our demonstrated photonic chip can
  generate and control the full set of spatial and polarization modes or their superposition
  in a two-mode few-mode optical fiber. High-quality beam structures can be obtained
  in experiments. In addition, efficient generation is achieved by our proposed chip-to-fiber
  emitter while using a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor compatible fabrication
  technology. Our findings present a scalable pathway towards achieving a portable
  and reliable system capable of achieving precise control, efficient emission, and
  adaptive reconfiguration for structured light in optical fibers.

ai_reason: This paper is highly relevant to your research interests due to its focus
  on "adaptive reconfiguration of light structure" and the use of "programmable silicon
  photonics," which aligns with your exploration of "fiber optic technology for wavefront
  sensing." The implications of achieving "precise control" and "efficient emission"
  in optical fibers suggest potential applications for Free Space Optical Communication
  and Adaptive Optics as you are investigating advancements in "wavefront shaping"
  and overall optical communication technologies.
