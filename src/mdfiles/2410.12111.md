abstract: The Thirty Meter Telescope will use a sophisticated adaptive optics system
  called NFIRAOS. This system utilizes two deformable mirrors conjugate to 0 km and
  11.2 km to apply a Multi-Conjugate Adaptive Optics (MCAO) correction over a 2 arcminute
  field of view. DM0 and DM11 have 63 and 75 actuators across their respective diameters.
  To study the behavior of these mirrors, we have developed a low-cost, very high-order
  Shack-Hartmann Wavefront Sensor (WFS). We will use our WFS to calibrate the flatness
  of the DMs and measure the influence functions of the actuators. NFIRAOS is cooled
  to reduce the thermal emissivity of optical surfaces visible to the science detectors,
  so we will also measure the behaviour of the DMs in both warm and cold environments.
  As the cold chamber is prone to vibrations, a WFS is preferred to a phase-shifting
  interferometer. Our design was driven by the need to be able to evaluate the DM
  surface between the actuators, which led to the requirement of at least 248 sub
  apertures across the diameter. The largest commercially available Shack-Hartmann
  WFS has only 128 sub-apertures across the diameter, which is not enough to properly
  sample these DMs. Furthermore, the designed sensor is able to record the wavefront
  at 50 FPS (50 times per second) at full resolution. To fabricate this WFS, we used
  a commercial off-the-shelf CMOS detector, camera lens, and lens let array, which
  kept the total cost less than 20K USD. Here we present the design and performance
  characteristics of this device.
