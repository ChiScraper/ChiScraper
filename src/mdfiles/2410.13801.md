abstract: The telecommunications industrys deployment of billions of kilometers of
  optical fiber has created a vast global network that can be exploited for additional
  applications such as environmental sensing, quantum networking and international
  clock comparisons. However, for reasons such as the unidirectionality of long-haul
  fiber links, telecom fiber networks cannot always be adapted for important applications
  beyond data transmission. Fortunately, new multicore optical fibers create the opportunity
  for application coexistence with data traffic, creating expansive multifunctional
  networks. Towards that end, we propose and demonstrate the faithful transfer of
  ultrastable optical signals through multicore fiber in a way that is compatible
  with the unidirectionality of long-haul fiber optic systems, demonstrating a fractional
  frequency instability of 3x10-19 at 10,000 seconds. This opens the door towards
  intercontinental optical clock comparisons, with applications in fundamental physics
  and the redefinition of the second.

ai_reason: The paper presents advancements in multicore optical fibers that may align
  with your interest in "fiber optic technology for wavefront sensing technology"
  by exploring how these fibers enable multifunctional telecommunications. While the
  primary focus is on optical frequency transfer and timing rather than Free Space
  Optical Communication or Adaptive Optics, it introduces techniques that could inform
  future developments in hybrid telecommunication applications relevant to your research.
