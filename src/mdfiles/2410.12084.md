abstract: Adaptive optics (AO) systems are crucial for high-resolution astronomical
  observations by compensating for atmospheric turbulence. While laser guide stars
  (LGS) address high-order wavefront aberrations, natural guide stars (NGS) remain
  vital for low-order wavefront sensing (LOWFS). Conventional NGS-based methods like
  Shack-Hartmann sensors have limitations in field of view, sensitivity, and complexity.
  Focal plane wavefront sensing (FPWFS) offers advantages, including a wider field
  of view and enhanced signal-to-noise ratio, but accurately estimating low-order
  modes from distorted point spread functions (PSFs) remains challenging. We propose
  an AI-powered FPWFS method specifically for low-order mode estimation in infrared
  wavelengths. Our approach is trained on simulated data and validated on on-telescope
  data collected from the Keck I adaptive optic (K1AO) bench calibration source in
  K-band. By leveraging the enhanced signal-to-noise ratio in the infrared and the
  power of AI, our method overcomes the limitations of traditional LOWFS techniques.
  This study demonstrates the effectiveness of AI-based FPWFS for low-order wavefront
  sensing, paving the way for more compact, efficient, and high-performing AO systems
  for astronomical observations.
