abstract: Interferometric techniques are crucial for space-based gravitational wave
  detection, requiring a picometer-level stable optical bench, precise phasemeter,
  interstellar transponder low-light phase locking, and laser sideband communication.
  These technologies must be rigorously tested on the ground before deployment in
  space. The AEI group has previously developed a picometer-stable hexapod optical
  bench to verify the linearity and precision of phase extraction for LISA. In this
  paper, we introduce a quadrangle quasi-monolithic optical bench aimed at simplifying
  the system and expanding the range of tested interferometric techniques for TianQin.
  Experimental results demonstrate that the system achieves picometer-level optical
  pathlength stability and phase resolution over a large dynamic range. In the laser
  transponder link test, the light phase-locked residual noise is lower than ${\rm
  10^{-4}\,rad/Hz^{1/2}}$ above millihertz frequency range, and the laser sideband
  modulation has no significant coupling to the measurements in the ${\rm mHz-Hz}$
  band. These results provide critical technical validation for the implementation
  of future gravitational wave detection in space.

ai_reason: This paper is relevant to your research interests as it discusses "interferometric
  techniques," which are critical for "space-based" applications, paralleling your
  focus on "Free Space Optical Communication" technologies used with satellites. Additionally,
  while it may not directly address "Adaptive Optics" or "wavefront sensors," the
  discussion of "picometer-level optical pathlength stability" and precise phase measurement
  can contribute valuable insights into improving optical communication systems you
  are exploring in your work.
