abstract: At frequencies below 1\,Hz, fluctuations in atmospheric emission in the
  Chajnantor region in northern Chile are the primary source of interference for bolometric
  millimeter-wave observations. This paper focuses on the statistics of these fluctuations
  using measurements from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and the Atacama Pathfinder
  Experiment (APEX) water vapor radiometer. After introducing a method for separating
  atmospheric effects from other systematic effects, we present a direct measurement
  of the temporal outer scale of turbulence of $\tau_0\approx50$ s corresponding to
  a spatial scale of $L_0\approx500$ m. At smaller scales, the fluctuations are well
  described by the Kolmogorov 2/3 power law until, at yet smaller scales, the effects
  of beam smearing become important. As a part of this study, we present measurements
  of the atmosphere by the APEX radiometer over 20 years, focused on fluctuations
  in precipitable water vapor (PWV). We find that the 30-minute mean of the total
  PWV is not in general a robust estimator of the level of fluctuations. We show that
  the microwave frequency spectrum of these fluctuations is in good agreement with
  predictions by the \texttt{am} code for bands above 90~GHz. We then show that the
  variance of fluctuations in ACTs mm-wave bands correlates with the variance of fluctuations
  in PWV measured by APEX, even though the observatories are 6\,km apart and observe
  different lines of sight. We find that ACTs atmosphere-determined optical efficiencies
  are consistent with previous planet-based results.

ai_reason: This paper discusses atmospheric emission and turbulence fluctuations,
  which are relevant issues in Free Space Optical Communication, particularly for
  applications in optical communication with satellites and spacecraft. However, the
  abstract primarily focuses on millimeter-wave observations rather than explicitly
  addressing Adaptive Optics, wavefront sensing, or other key areas such as photonic
  lanterns and fiber optic technology, which are central to your research.
