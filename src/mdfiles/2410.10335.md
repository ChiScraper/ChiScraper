abstract: In this study, we statistically analyze the performance of a threshold-based
  multiple optical signal selection scheme (TMOS) for wavelength division multiplexing
  (WDM) and adaptive coded modulation (ACM) using free space optical (FSO) communication
  between mobile platforms in maritime environments with fog and 3D pointing errors.
  Specifically, we derive a new closed-form expression for a composite probability
  density function (PDF) that is more appropriate for applying various algorithms
  to FSO systems under the combined effects of fog and pointing errors. We then analyze
  the outage probability, average spectral efficiency (ASE), and bit error rate (BER)
  performance of the conventional detection techniques (i.e., heterodyne and intensity
  modulation/direct detection). The derived analytical results were cross-verified
  using Monte Carlo simulations. The results show that we can obtain a higher ASE
  performance by applying TMOS-based WDM and ACM and that the probability of the beam
  being detected in the photodetector increased at a low signal-to-noise ratio, contrary
  to conventional performance. Furthermore, it has been confirmed that applying WDM
  and ACM is suitable, particularly in maritime environments where channel conditions
  frequently change.
