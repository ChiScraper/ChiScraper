abstract: Controlling the symmetry of optical and mechanical waves is pivotal to their
  full exploitation in technological applications and topology-linked fundamental
  physics experiments. Leveraging on the control of orbital angular momentum, we introduce
  here a device forming super-high-frequency-modulated optical vortex beams via acousto-optic
  interaction of light with acoustic vortices. Originated by shape-engineering of
  a single-contact bulk acoustic wave resonator, we generate vortices in a wide band
  of frequencies around 4 GHz and with frequency/geometrically tunable topological
  charge from 1 to 13 and beyond. With all electrical control and on-chip integration
  our device offers new solutions for angular-momentum-based light communication,
  three-dimensional particle manipulation, as well as novel interaction schemes for
  optomechanical devices.

ai_reason: The paper discusses "angular-momentum-based light communication," which
  aligns with my interest in "Free Space Optical Communication technologies" and relates
  to the manipulation of optical waves in a manner that could involve adaptive optics
  techniques. Additionally, the focus on generating "vortex beams" suggests a possible
  intersection with "wavefront shaping," which is a key area of interest in my research
  on using fiber optic technology for wavefront sensing.
