abstract: The propagation of wave fields and their interactions with matter are important
  for established and emerging fields in optical sciences. Efficient methods for predicting
  such behaviour have been employed routinely for coherent sources. However, most
  real world optical systems exhibit partial coherence, for which the present mathematical
  description involves high dimensional complex functions and hence poses challenges
  for numerical implementations. This demands significant computational resources
  to determine the properties of partially coherent wavefields. Here, we describe
  the novel Phase-Space (PS) propagator, an efficient and self-consistent technique
  for free space propagation of wave fields which are partially coherent in the spatial
  domain. The PS propagator makes use of the fact that the propagation of a wave field
  in free space is equivalent to a shearing of the corresponding PSD function. Computationally,
  this approach is simpler and the need for using different propagation methods for
  near and far-field regions is removed.

ai_reason: This paper is relevant to your interests as it discusses the propagation
  of wave fields in a free space context, which directly relates to Free Space Optical
  Communication technologies. Additionally, the mention of partially coherent wave
  fields aligns with your focus on adaptive optics and wavefront sensing techniques,
  particularly in simplifying computational methods for these optical communications
  applications.
