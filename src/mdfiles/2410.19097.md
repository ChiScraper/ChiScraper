abstract: Single-shot hyperspectral wavefront sensing is essential for applications
  like spatio-spectral coupling metrology in high power laser or fast material dispersion
  imaging. Under broadband illumination, traditional wavefront sensors assume an achromatic
  wavefront, which makes them unsuitable. We introduce a hyperspectral wavefront sensing
  scheme based on the Hartmann wavefront sensing principles, employing a multicore
  fiber as a modified Hartmann mask to overcome these limitations. Our system leverages
  the angular memory effect and spectral decorrelation from the multicore fiber, encoding
  wavefront gradients into displacements and the spectral information into uncorrelated
  patterns. This method retains the simplicity, compactness, and single-shot capability
  of conventional wavefront sensors, with only a slight increase in computational
  complexity. It also allows a tunable trade-off between spatial and spectral resolution.
  We demonstrate its efficacy for recording the hyperspectral wavefront cube from
  single-pulse acquisitions at the Apollon multi-PW laser facility, and for performing
  multispectral microscopic imaging of dispersive phase objects.

ai_reason: The paper is highly relevant to your research interests in Adaptive Optics
  and wavefront sensing technologies, as it focuses on "hyperspectral wavefront sensing"
  and employs a "multicore fiber" to enhance traditional methods, aligning with your
  focus on "fiber optic technology for wavefront sensing." Additionally, the mention
  of applications in high-power lasers and the capture of "hyperspectral wavefront
  cubes" directly ties into your study of wavefront shaping and optical communication
  systems in space applications.
