abstract: MAVIS (the MCAO-Assisted Visible Imager and Spectrograph), planned for the
  VLT Adaptive Optics Facility, represents an innovative step in Multi-Conjugate Adaptive
  Optics (MCAO) systems, particularly in its operation at visible wavelengths and
  anticipated contributions to the field of astronomical astrometry. Recognizing the
  crucial role of high-precision astrometry in realizing science goals such as studying
  the dynamics of dense starfields, this study focuses on the challenges of advancing
  astrometry with MAVIS to its limits, as well as paving the way for further enhancement
  by incorporating telemetry data as part of the astrometric analysis. We employ MAVISIM,
  Superstar, and DAOPHOT to simulate both MAVIS imaging performance and provide a
  pathway to incorporate telemetry data for precise astrometry with MAVIS. Photometry
  analyses are conducted using the Superstar and DAOPHOT platforms, integrated into
  a specifically designed pipeline for astrometric analysis in MCAO settings. Combining
  these platforms, our research aims to elucidate the impact of utilizing telemetry
  data on improving astrometric precision, potentially establishing new methods for
  ground-based AO-assisted astrometric analysis. This endeavor not only sheds light
  on the capabilities of MAVIS but also paves the way for advancing astrometry in
  the era of next-generation MCAO-enabled giant telescopes.
