abstract: Polarized topological vertical cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs),
  as stable and efficient on-chip light sources, play an important role in the next
  generation of optical storage and optical communications. However, most current
  topological lasers demand complex design and expensive fabrication processes, and
  their semiconductor-based structures pose challenges for flexible device applications.
  By use of an analogy with two-dimensional Semenov insulators in synthetic parametric
  space, we design and realize a one-dimensional optical superlattice (stacked polymerized
  cholesteric liquid crystal films and Mylar films), thereby we demonstrate a flexible,
  low threshold, circularly polarized topological VCSEL with high slope efficiency.
  We show that such a laser maintains a good single-mode property under low pump power
  and inherits the transverse spatial profile of the pump laser. Thanks to the soft-matter-based
  flexibility, our topological VCSEL can be `attached` to substrates of various shapes,
  enabling desired laser properties and robust beam steering even after undergoing
  hundreds of bends. Our results may find applications in consumer electronics, laser
  scanning and displays, as well as wearable devices.
