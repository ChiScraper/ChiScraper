abstract: Existing communication hardware is being exerted to its limits to accommodate
  for the ever increasing internet usage globally. This leads to non-linear distortion
  in the communication link that requires non-linear equalization techniques to operate
  the link at a reasonable bit error rate. This paper addresses the challenge of blind
  non-linear equalization using a variational autoencoder (VAE) with a second-order
  Volterra channel model. The VAE frameworks costfunction, the evidence lower bound
  (ELBO), is derived for real-valued constellations and can be evaluated analytically
  without resorting to sampling techniques. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
  approach through simulations on a synthetic Wiener-Hammerstein channel and a simulated
  intensity modulated direct detection (IM/DD) optical link. The results show significant
  improvements in equalization performance, compared to a VAE with linear channel
  assumptions, highlighting the importance of appropriate channel modeling in unsupervised
  VAE equalizer frameworks.

ai_reason: The paper discusses "non-linear equalization techniques" and "optical link"
  which are relevant to your focus on Free Space Optical Communication, specifically
  in the context of ensuring reliable communication with satellites and spacecraft.
  However, it lacks a direct emphasis on Adaptive Optics, wavefront sensing technologies,
  or the use of fiber optic technology, reducing its direct applicability to your
  specific research interests.
