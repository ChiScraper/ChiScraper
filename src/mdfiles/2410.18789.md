abstract: Free-space optical communication (FSOC) systems offer high-bandwidth and
  secure communication with minimal capital costs. Adaptive optics (AO) are typically
  added to these systems to decrease atmospheric channel losses; however, the performance
  of traditional AO wavefront sensors degrades in long-range, deep turbulence conditions.
  Alternative wavefront sensors using phase diversity can successfully reconstruct
  wavefronts in deep turbulence, but current implementations require bulky setups
  with high latency. In this work, we employ a nanostructured birefringent metasurface
  optic that enables low-latency phase diversity wavefront sensing in a compact form
  factor. We prove the effectiveness of this approach in mid-to-high turbulence (Rytov
  numbers from 0.2 to 0.6) through simulation and experimental demonstration. In both
  cases an average 16-fold increase in signal from the corrected beam is obtained.
  Our approach opens a pathway for compact, robust wavefront sensing that enhances
  range and accuracy of FSOC systems.

ai_reason: The paper is highly relevant to your research on Adaptive Optics in Free
  Space Optical Communication, particularly through its exploration of "phase diversity
  wavefront sensing" which directly relates to your interests in "wavefront sensors"
  and "wavefront shaping." Additionally, the focus on using a "nanostructured birefringent
  metasurface optic" for low-latency sensing addresses the challenges of deep turbulence
  conditions, aligning well with your goal of improving the performance of optical
  communication systems.
