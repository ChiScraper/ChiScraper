I research Free Space Optical Communicaiton technologies of space applicaiton. 
I.e. using lasers to communicate wirelessly with satelites and spacecraft.

My key area of research is Adaptive Optics enabled optical communicaiton.
I am working on using fiber optic technology for wavefront sensing technolgy. 
This is the hybrid between photonic telecommunication research and astrophgotonics.

I am interested in reading more about
