abstract: Purpose... To develop an MRI technique for free-breathing 3D whole-liver
  quantification of water T1, water T2, proton density fat fraction (PDFF), R2*. Methods...
  An Eight-echo spoiled gradient echo pulse sequence with spiral readout was developed
  by interleaving inversion recovery and T2 magnetization preparation. We propose
  a neural network based on a 4D and a 3D implicit neural representation (INR) which
  simultaneously learns the motion deformation fields and the static reference frame
  MRI subspace images respectively. Water and fat singular images were separated during
  network training, with no need of performing retrospective water-fat separation.
  T1, T2, R2* and proton density fat fraction (PDFF) produced by the proposed method
  were validated in vivo on 10 healthy subjects, using quantitative maps generated
  from conventional scans as reference. Results... Our results showed minimal bias
  and narrow 95% limits of agreement on T1, T2, R2* and PDFF values in the liver compared
  to conventional breath-holding scans. Conclusions... INR-MRF enabled co-registered
  3D whole liver T1, T2, R2* and PDFF mapping in a single free-breathing scan.

ai_reason: This paper is not highly relevant to your research interests, as it focuses
  on MRI techniques for liver quantification rather than Free Space Optical Communication
  or Adaptive Optics. The methods and results outlined in the abstract, which deal
  with magnetic resonance imaging and neural networks, do not align with your focus
  on "using lasers to communicate wirelessly with satellites and spacecraft" or topics
  like "wavefront sensing technology" that are central to your work.
