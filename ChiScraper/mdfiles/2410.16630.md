abstract: We introduce a theoretical framework that allows for the systematic and
  efficient description of the ultrafast nonlinear response of molecular polaritons,
  i.e., hybrid light-matter states, in the collective regime of large numbers of molecules
  $\mathcal N$ coupled to the cavity photon mode. Our approach is based on a semiclassical,
  mean-field evolution of the molecular Hamiltonian and the cavity field, which is
  complemented by a perturbative expansion of both light and matter counterparts in
  the input fields entering the cavity. In addition, expansion in terms of the pulse
  phases enables us to disentangle different excitation pathways in Liouville space,
  thereby distinguishing contributions to the nonlinear response. The formalism extends
  traditional free-space nonlinear spectroscopy by incorporating the feedback of matter
  onto the light field via the induced polarization. We demonstrate the utility of
  the framework by applying it to the calculation of pump-probe polariton spectra
  and show how, by storing the pulses, the cavity facilitates additional excitation
  pathways which are not possible in free space. Our method, which does not scale
  with $\mathcal N$ , is broadly applicable and can be extended to a wide range of
  current experiments investigating the dynamical nonlinear response of hybrid light-matter
  states.

ai_reason: This paper discusses a theoretical framework for ultrafast nonlinear spectroscopy
  involving hybrid light-matter states, which could potentially intersect with aspects
  of Free Space Optical Communication, particularly in understanding light interactions.
  However, while it mentions concepts like fields coupled to cavity modes, it does
  not directly address Adaptive Optics, wavefront sensing, or any of the specific
  technologies you are focusing on, thus providing limited relevance to your core
  interests.
