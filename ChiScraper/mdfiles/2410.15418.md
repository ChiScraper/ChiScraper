abstract: This paper significantly advances the application of Quantum Key Distribution
  (QKD) in Free- Space Optics (FSO) satellite-based quantum communication. We propose
  an innovative satellite quantum channel model and derive the secret quantum key
  distribution rate achievable through this channel. Unlike existing models that approximate
  the noise in quantum channels as merely Gaussian distributed, our model incorporates
  a hybrid noise analysis, accounting for both quantum Poissonian noise and classical
  Additive-White-Gaussian Noise (AWGN). This hybrid approach acknowledges the dual
  vulnerability of continuous variables (CV) Gaussian quantum channels to both quantum
  and classical noise, thereby offering a more realistic assessment of the quantum
  Secret Key Rate (SKR). This paper delves into the variation of SKR with the Signal-to-Noise
  Ratio (SNR) under various influencing parameters. We identify and analyze critical
  factors such as reconciliation efficiency, transmission coefficient, transmission
  efficiency, the quantum Poissonian noise parameter, and the satellite altitude.
  These parameters are pivotal in determining the SKR in FSO satellite quantum channels,
  highlighting the challenges of satellitebased quantum communication. Our work provides
  a comprehensive framework for understanding and optimizing SKR in satellite-based
  QKD systems, paving the way for more efficient and secure quantum communication
  networks.
