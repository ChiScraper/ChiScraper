abstract: Numerical inspection of wide-angle (WA) or ultra-wide-angle (UWA) computer-generated
  holograms (CGH) is a computationally demanding task. To surpass this limitation,
  we propose a novel computational approach for fast and accurate WA-CGH reconstruction
  based on Fast Fourier transform Fresnel diffraction (FrT) and non-uniform frequency
  hologram magnification. This novel algorithm, referred to as the non-uniform Fourier
  Domain Stretching (NU-FDS) method, is based on approximating a spherical wave coming
  from any object point with a parabolic wave, with the points of convergence of the
  two waves being different. It is supported by a mathematical solution developed
  using phase-space to determine the frequency distribution needed to find the distribution
  of non-uniform magnification. It corrects the axial distance of a parabolic wave
  so the FrT solution can be applied for WA-CGH reconstruction. The NU-FDS algorithm
  also allows the reconstruction of a partial view with freedom of position and size
  selection, reducing computation time. In this way, the NU-FDS method enables fast
  and accurate quantitative assessment of the 3D information coded into the CGH. The
  presented evidence shows that the NU-FDS algorithm can accurately and efficiently
  reconstruct large and highly detailed 3D objects from WA and UWA CGH of FoV and
  resolution up to 120{\deg} and 16K, respectively.

ai_reason: This paper's exploration of "ultra-wide-angle wave propagation" and the
  computational efficiency of wavefront reconstruction closely resonates with your
  research interests in "wavefront sensing technology" and "adaptive optics." The
  focus on holographic techniques for "fast and accurate quantitative assessment"
  of wave information aligns with your goal of developing efficient communication
  methods using fiber optic technology in the context of optical communication in
  space applications.
