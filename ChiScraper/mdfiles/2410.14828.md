abstract: We introduce a toluene-filled fiber platform for two-photon absorption measurements.
  By confining both the light and molecular sample inside the 5 $\mu$ m hollow core
  of the fiber, we increase the distance over which the nonlinear light-matter interaction
  occurs. With only a 7.3 nL excitation volume, we measure classical two-photon absorption
  (C2PA) at an average laser power as low as 1.75 nW, which is a 45-fold improvement
  over a conventional free-space technique. We use this platform to attempt to measure
  entangled two-photon absorption (E2PA), a process with a limited operating regime
  due to a crossover in dominating processes from E2PA to C2PA as photon flux is increased.
  Recently, several teams of researchers have reported that E2PA cross sections are
  much smaller than previously claimed. As a result, the process dominates at photon
  fluxes so low that it is extremely difficult or impossible to measure using conventional
  free-space techniques. In this report, we implement the first E2PA measurement using
  a waveguide. We see no evidence of E2PA, and we set an upper bound on the cross
  section consistent with these recent reports.

ai_reason: The paper presents a liquid-core fiber platform that focuses on two-photon
  absorption measurements, which may be relevant to your interest in "fiber optic
  technology for wavefront sensing." However, its primary focus on two-photon absorption
  techniques within a liquid-core fiber does not align closely with your specific
  interest in "Adaptive Optics enabled optical communication" or the hybrid applications
  of photonic telecommunication and astrophotonics, thus providing limited insights
  into your niche research area.
