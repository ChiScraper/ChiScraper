abstract: Maximally localized Wannier functions use the gauge freedom of Bloch wavefunctions
  to define the optimally smooth subspace with matrix elements that depend smoothly
  on crystal momentum. The associated Wannier functions are real-space localized,
  a feature often used to Fourier interpolate periodic observables in reciprocal space
  on ultradense momentum grids. However, Fourier interpolation cannot handle non-periodic
  quantities in reciprocal space, such as the oscillator strength matrix elements,
  which are crucial for the evaluation of optical properties. We show that a direct
  multidimensional interpolation in the optimally smooth subspace yields comparable
  accuracy with respect to Fourier interpolation at a similar or lower computational
  cost. This approach can also interpolate and extrapolate non-periodic observables,
  enabling the calculation of optical properties on ultradense momentum grids. Finally,
  we underline that direct interpolation in the optimally smooth subspace can be employed
  for periodic and non-periodic tensors of any order without any information on the
  position of the Wannier centers in real space.
ai_rating: 2.5
ai_reason: The paper focuses on maximizing the efficiency of optical properties calculations
  through "maximally localized Wannier functions" and their application to periodic
  and non-periodic observables, but it does not primarily address Free Space Optical
  Communication or Adaptive Optics, which are central to your research interests.
  While it mentions "optical properties," it lacks specific references to laser communications,
  wavefront sensing, or the kind of adaptive optical technologies that are critical
  to your work in creating efficient communication with satellites and spacecraft.
