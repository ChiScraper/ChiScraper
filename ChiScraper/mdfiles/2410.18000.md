abstract: A crucial component of the high-contrast instrumental chain in astronomy
  is the wavefront sensor (WFS). A key property of this component is its sensitivities,
  which reflect its ability to efficiently use incoming photons to encode the phase
  aberrations. This paper introduces a new class of highly sensitive wavefront sensors
  that approach the fundamental sensitivity limits dictated by physics. Assuming a
  high Strehl regime, we define what linear operator is describing the ideal WFS that
  would achieve maximum sensitivity. We then show that there is a substantial similarity
  between this ideal WFS and the second-order ideal coronagraph. Leveraging the exhibited
  link between ideal wavefront sensing and coronagraphy, we propose a novel WFS concept
  based on high-performance coronagraphic architecture ... the bivortex WFS. This
  sensor employs charge-2 vortex masks. Simulations for an ideal system demonstrate
  that this sensor achieves unprecedented sensitivity, even surpassing the highly
  sensitive Zernike WFS class (especially for low spatial frequencies), while paving
  the way for new high-contrast architectures integrating simultaneous sensing and
  coronagraphy.

ai_reason: The paper discusses a "novel WFS concept based on high-performance coronagraphic
  architecture," which directly aligns with your research interests in "wavefront
  sensing technology" and "Adaptive Optics enabled optical communication." Additionally,
  the focus on achieving "unprecedented sensitivity" in wavefront sensors contributes
  valuable insights that could enhance your work on fiber optic technology and its
  applications in Free Space Optical Communication.
