abstract: Extracting information from complex data is a challenge shared by multiple
  frontiers of modern astrophysical research. Among those, analyzing spectra cubes,
  where the emission is mapped in the position-position-velocity space is a difficult
  task given the vast amount of information contained within. The cubes often contain
  a superposition of emissions and absorptions, where extracting absorption signatures
  is often necessary. One example is the extraction of narrow absorption structures
  in HI 21 cm emission spectra. These HI self-absorption (HISA) clouds trace the cold
  HI gas in interstellar space. We introduce an automatic and robust method called
  the \emph{inverted EEMD} method to extract narrow features from spectral cubes.
  Our method is based on the EEMD method, an established method to decompose 1d signals.
  The method is robust and parameter-free, making it useful in analyzing spectral
  cubes containing localized absorption signals of different types. The inverted-EEMD
  method is suitable for the analysis of spectral cubes where it can produce a cube
  containing the absorption signal and one containing the unabsorbed signal, where
  cold clouds can be identified as coherent regions in the absorption map. A Python
  implementation of the method is available at \url{https...//github.com/zhenzhen-research/inverted_eemd_map}.
ai_rating: 2.5
ai_reason: The paper focuses on the "extraction of narrow absorption structures in
  HI 21 cm emission spectra," which pertains more to spectral analysis in astrophysics
  rather than the communication technologies you are specifically researching, such
  as "Free Space Optical Communication" and "Adaptive Optics." Although it discusses
  advanced analytical methods that may tangentially relate to fields involving optical
  signals, it does not directly contribute to your interests in wavefront sensing
  or fiber optic technology, making it less relevant to your work.
