abstract: The wireless channel changes continuously with time and frequency and the
  block-fading assumption, which is popular in many theoretical analyses, never holds
  true in practical scenarios. This discrepancy is critical for user activity detection
  in grant-free random access, where joint processing across multiple coherence blocks
  is undesirable, especially when the environment becomes more dynamic. In this paper,
  we develop a framework for low-dimensional approximation of the channel to capture
  its variations over time and frequency, and use this framework to implement robust
  activity detection algorithms. Furthermore, we investigate how to efficiently estimate
  the principal subspace that defines the low-dimensional approximation. We also examine
  pilot hopping as a way of exploiting time and frequency diversity in scenarios with
  limited channel coherence, and extend our algorithms to this case. Through numerical
  examples, we demonstrate a substantial performance improvement achieved by our proposed
  framework.
ai_rating: 2.5
ai_reason: The paper's focus on "user activity detection in grant-free random access"
  does not align with my interest in Free Space Optical Communication technologies,
  particularly the use of lasers for communication with satellites and spacecraft.
  While the framework presents a method relevant to wireless communications, it lacks
  specific ties to "Adaptive Optics," "wavefront sensing technology," or the integration
  of "fiber optic technology" in optical communication applications, making its contribution
  limited to my research area.
