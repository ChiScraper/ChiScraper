abstract: We study the spatially incoherent light generated by a multimode fiber(MMF)
  in the application of image projection designed for the ultracold-atom experiments.
  Inspired by previous half-analytic methods concerning the incoherent light, here
  a full-numerical model is established to provide more quantitative descriptions,
  and part of results is compared with experiments. Particularly, our model about
  the MMF is also compatible with light propagation in free space. Based on this,
  we study both the intrinsic speckle and the perturbation robustness of a MMF light
  field, under the influence of light propagation and fiber parameters. We point out
  several guidelines about choosing the suitable MMF in creating a spatially incoherent
  light source, which is useful in the context of the ultracold-atom experiments associating
  with the optical potential projection.

ai_reason: This paper is somewhat relevant to your research interests as it discusses
  "the spatially incoherent light generated by a multimode fiber," which aligns with
  your focus on "using fiber optic technology for wavefront sensing technology." While
  the primary application concerns ultracold-atom experiments, the exploration of
  light propagation in free space is pertinent to your work in Free Space Optical
  Communication technologies.
