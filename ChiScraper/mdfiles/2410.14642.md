abstract: In this paper, we explore cooperative sensing and communication within cell-free
  integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. Specifically, multiple transmit
  access points (APs) collaboratively serve multiple communication users while simultaneously
  illuminating a potential target, with a separate sensing AP dedicated to collecting
  echo signals for target detection. To improve the performance of identifying a moving
  target in the presence of strong interference originating from transmit APs, we
  employ the space-time adaptive processing (STAP) technique and jointly optimize
  the transmit/receive beamforming. Our goal is to maximize the radar output signal-to-interference-plus-noise
  ratio (SINR), subject to the communication SINR requirements and the power budget.
  An efficient alternating algorithm is developed to solve the resulting non-convex
  optimization problem. Simulations demonstrate significant performance improvements
  in target detection and validate the advantages of the proposed joint STAP and beamforming
  design for cell-free ISAC systems.

ai_reason: The paper's focus on "cooperative sensing and communication within cell-free
  integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems" presents a somewhat relevant
  perspective, albeit predominantly within a radar and wireless communication context
  rather than directly addressing "Free Space Optical Communication" or "Adaptive
  Optics". However, the use of "beamforming" and "target detection" could provide
  insights that may be tangentially useful for understanding adaptive techniques in
  optical communication, given your interest in "wavefront shaping" and "wavefront
  sensors".
